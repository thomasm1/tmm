<h1>International Travel Planning Tips</h1>

<p>Being prepared and anticipating needs and requirements can make all the difference when it comes to ensuring that your trip abroad will be an enjoyable one, instead of disappointing or unpleasant. The following are some tips to help you plan your next trip abroad.
</p>
	
<h2>Get Any Required Vaccinations and Immunizations</h2>

<p>You may be required to get various vaccinations or immunizations when traveling to various parts of the world. You can find out about vaccinations or immunizations that may be required for travel to or from different countries at your county or state health department.</p>
	
<h2>Passport and Visas</h2>

<p>A visa may be required to gain entrance to many countries. Many foreign countries require the obtaining of a visa to gain entry. It is your responsibility to obtain any visas that may be required. Some foreign countries waive the requirement for a visa for short stays by tourists, for instance; this is the case in most Western European countries.</p>
	
<h3>Protect Your Passport</h3>
	
<p>Make a photocopy of your passport's page with your photo and identification details, request a duplicate copy of your birth certificate, and have two additional passport photos printed. Having these with you can help expedite getting a replacement, in case your passport is lost or stolen.</p>
	
<h2>Check Your Coverages</h2>

<p>Check to see if your medical insurance policy will cover you while traveling abroad. If not, medical insurance is available to cover you during your trip. Also, you may want to consider getting insurance providing for emergency medical evacuation, if such should be necessary, especially if the area you'll be traveling to lacks top-flight medical   facilities and personnel. Ask your travel agent for details.</p>
	
<p>If you take required medications, have your doctor write new prescriptions for you using generic drug names, since brand names for drugs may vary from country to country.</p>
	
<h2>Take Care of Your Money</h2>

<p>Don't risk having your passport, travelers' checks, credit cards, cash, and other important items lost or stolen. Carrying these in pockets or handbags is begging for them to be stolen. <span class="important">Get a good money belt so you can keep your valuables where thieves or pickpockets can't easily get to them.</span> Some travelers have pouches sewn onto the inside of their underwear because thieves will often have people strip down to their skivvies.</p>
	
<p><span class="important">Travelers' checks are better than cash, since they can be replaced, while cash can't.</span> Also take your credit card, but check with your bank or provider to make sure it'll be accepted where you're going. Before leaving, learn what the current currency-exchange rate is, as well as what the usual currency-exchange fees are. Be sure to carry a small    calculator.</p>
	
<h2>Don't Overpack!</h2>

<p>International flights may have more restrictive weight and different size allowances for baggage than is the case for domestic flights. If you can manage it, restrict yourself to one checked bag and one carry-on bag. For added versatility and ease in carrying, consider making your carry-on a backpack; you can also then use it for day excursions once you get to your destination. Especially if you'll have a long flight, make sure you've placed anything you'll need during your flight in your carry-on bag. Don't take more clothing than you'll realistically need--get laundry done at your hotel, rather than carry extra clothes.    Remember, there are only two kinds of travelers: those who packed light and those who wish they had.</p>
	
<h2>Take the Right Converters and Adapters</h2>
	
<p>The electrical current used in Europe and many other countries is 220 volts, instead of 110 volts as in the United States. If you don't have the right converter or adapter, you won't be able to use your electric shaver or hair dryer, for instance. Most laptops have built in adapters, but be sure to check your documentation.</p>
	
<h2>Do Not Carry Packages for Others</h2>

<p class="important">Do not carry packages, money, or messages for anyone else from one country to another, unless you've received specific authorization to do so from the countries involved. When at the airport, do not leave your bags unattended, even for a moment.</p>
