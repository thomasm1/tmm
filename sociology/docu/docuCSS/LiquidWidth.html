<p>For this assignment you will be creating HTML documents and CSS rules that will use some of the positioning elements of CSS to create a two column fixed-width layout and two column liquid for two HTML documents as discussed in the text. You will also need to create the THML documents with the appropriate   elements. Create an HTML document with content of your liking.
This assignment deals mainly with the creation of the layout of the pages, however I encourage you to use skills learned earlier to style fonts, text-effects, colors etc.
