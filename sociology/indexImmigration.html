<div id="immigration" ><h3 class="rightalign">Blog on Immigration Issues</h3>
<h5>This blog discusses different legal and socio-economic aspects faced by migrants upon arrival into the U.S.<br />This blog's goal is to present immigration facts, current scholarship, and the historical origin of current political movements</h5> <br /><br />
<h2>What Drives the Contemporary Immigration Attention?</h2> 
<h2>Immigrant Neighborhood Enclaves, Segmented Assimmilation, and the Samuel Huntington Doctrine</h2>
<p>In 2008, a renowned historian and geopolitical scholar quietly died of old age. The surly Dr. Samuel Huntington witnessed most of the 20th century's tumults, many of which were recorded into his 2003 publication of <em>Who Are We?</em> The era of the last century also permeates the author's views. This work spells out the Huntingtonian Doctrine that posits a nationalist, Puritan-like vision of America and American culture. Huntington's primary claim is that American culture and English language are endangered by the growing phenomenon of urban neighborhood enclaves whose residents are primarily 1st, 2nd, and 3rd generation immigrants that speak their native tongue exclusively or primarily in daily affairs. This, with other cultural-assimilation measures forms the nativist, exclusionist worldview that justifies xenophobic opinions, anti-immigration, anti-globalism worldview.  This anti-immigration, nativist worldview played an important role in the 2016 Brexit, the 2017 French presidential election platform of Marine LePen, and other nations including Holland and Austria. 
Legal and socio-economic explanations about cultural assimilation within immigrant neighborhood enclaves remains divided between 21st century sociology versus the 1900's-esque xenophobia of the Samuel Huntington doctrine. The former is based on soci-economic behavioral metrics, while the latter asserts the primacy of historical ethno-nationalism.  Therefore, this essay blog compares and contrasts, with academic neutrality, legal, social, cultural and economic aspects of modern immigration, and the two opposing viewpoints between Sociological analysis and the Nativist, anti-immigration Hungtingtonian doctrine. </p>  <span id="toggle">
Click to read more... <br /> </span>
<div  id="textimmig"><p>I highlight these controversial issues in the spirit of descriptive neutrality and leave it to the reader's discretion whether or not to associate the doctrine with the current White House administration's Executive actions on Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) immigration policy.  <br /> 

First, a word on the issues and the stakes of the modern American immigration policy, and the science underpinning the debates. Social science begins with the collection of individual data on immigrants' ethnic origins and their current legal and socio-economic circumstance. The opposing view dismisses legal and socio-economic data, in favor of the argument that immigrant behavior is determined by the immigrant's nation of origin, and thus genealogical roots and ethnic phenotype.  This latter view is a snapshot of the post-Reconstruction, 1900's-era American belief system  a view that predates contemporary psychology of Skinner, the sociology of Bourdieu, and behavioral economics of Milton Friedman.  Since the era of modern social science, structure-based immigrant behavior is, in a nutshell, operationalized by two variables: legality of stay (as determined by the Immigration and Naturalization Service) and socio-economic ability, i.e. structural needs, wants, and goals, and is operationalized by occupational/income-earning power, educational achievement, and expected duration of stay in the host country.   <br />  <br /> 
</p> <br />  
<h1>Structural Drivers of Assimilation</h1>
<h3>Socio-Economic Status and Circumstance 
</h3>
<p>  
Current U.S. immigrants arrive with very disparate legal and socio-economic circumstances.  These two indicators of structural circumstance determine the course of the immigrants' stay.  Accordingly, they determine the pattern of cultural assimilation for each immigrant and their ability to attain the same status and culture as the typical, middle-class American (Suarez-Orozco, 2000).  Cultural assimilation follows hand-in-hand with upward career mobility.  [Assimilation] is the cumulative byproduct of choices made by individuals seeking to take advantage of opportunities to improve their social situations' (Alba, 1995). <br />  <br /> 
Interestingly, the current immigrant arrives in an economic job market that is highly segregated.  Using an hourglass metaphor, there is either a "well-remunerated, knowledge-intensive economic sphere [or] a service economy where low-skilled and semi-skilled workers continue to lose ground in terms of real wages, benefits, and security. Therefore immigrants fall into one or the other labor market" (Suarez-Orozco, 2000). It follows that immigrant groups are statistically divided along the same line as the economic and educational development of the nation of origin. <br />  <br /> 
The U.S. immigrant from any national origin falls into two very different structural categories upon arrival.  They range from highly skilled to unskilled and poorly educated, These circumstances strongly affect the immigrant experience and subsequent pattern of assimilation (Portes and Rumbaut, 1996). The lesser-skilled workers have the only choice of accepting jobs that offer no upward mobility and their housing is forced into urban, ethnically segregated neighborhoods.  The highly skilled workers, with their education and language ability, are offered jobs that support a work and residence lifestyle that involves interaction with middle-class America, while at the same time prospering cultural assimilation.  For this reason, Portes and Rumbaut (2001) identify two prominent types of immigrant assimilation. The first type is able to adopt mainstream American customs, speaks English, and is upwardly mobile within one or two generations.  The second type, based on socio-economic circumstances, acculturates to inner-city subcultures, low education level and labor market, even after several generations.   <br />  <br /> </p>
<h3>Expectation of Stay and Legality</h3>
<p>  
 
In the past, immigrants had few opportunities to communicate, visit, or even return to the sending nation, thereby facilitating the process of cultural assimilation.  Expected length of stay and naturalization of the immigrant in the host nation is an essential element in the immigrant's desire to assimilate.  If the immigrant plans to stay temporarily in the host nation, there is less need to learn the culture of the host nation (Guarnizo, 2003).  For example, one in five Mexican immigrants will choose to acquire American citizenship (Chavez, 1998).  Guarnizo says that propensity to engage in entrepreneurial ventures varies systematically with the socially-expected duration (SED) of migration.  In other words, temporary SED's  "preserve ties with the country and community of origin."  Of course, SED is primarily affected by legality of stay and the option to naturalize.  Whether the immigrant works illegally, holds a temporary worker visa or is naturalized has a tremendous impact on the immigrant's SED. 
Because of mass transportation, transnationalism has revolutionized the concept of the immigration process by invalidating the traditional "clean break" assumption globalized communication and information technologies immigrants are no longer tied to one country (Suarez-Orozco, 2000).  Furthermore, developing nations support dual-nationality in order to encourage monetary remittances from former emigrants temporarily residing in other nations.  Developed nations encourage temporary worker immigrants in order to fill gaps in labor market.  These factors affect both the expectation of stay and the legality question among immigrants into the United States.  The bottom line is that immigrants that stay temporarily or expect to be deported for legal reasons are not likely to assimilate into American culture.  
 </p>
 <br /> 
<h3>Anti-Science Huntingtonian Doctrine on Cultural Assimilation  </h3>
<p>
In the past, U.S. immigration has been likened to the Tomato Soup analogy, that is, tomatoes provide the substance, but immigration provides the herbs and spice.  All immigrants regardless of origin and socio-economic circumstance find a niche in American society, eventually adopting its culture over one or two generations.  However, the inherent racism of Huntingtonian doctrine departs from science by claiming an exception to the rule:  Mexican immigration differs from past and present immigration trends.  The generalization is that certain ethnic groups are less willing to culturally assimilate.  According to this theoretical viewpoint, the ethnic identity and culture of the incoming Mexican immigrant repudiates, like oil with water, fundamental aspects of American culture such as language, values, and norms. <br />  <br /> 
For this cause, Huntingtonian doctrine predicts a potential bifurcation, again like oil with water, of American society.  This predicted bilingual and bicultural division will ultimately lead to a bicognitive American self-identity and culture.  "Unlike past immigrant groups," Huntington writes, "Mexicans and other Latinos have not assimilated into mainstream U.S. culture, forming instead their own political and linguistic enclaves ... and rejecting the Anglo-Protestant values that built the American dream" (Huntington, 2004).  The growing popularity of racist notions poses an existential threat to American identity, and yet few understand any causal explanation; for this reason, one must search for cultural origins to understand their current evolution.
</p> <br /> 
 
<p>Huntingtonian doctrine asserts two principles for asserting that immigrants of Mexican origin are less likely to culturally assimilate than other immigrant groups. The first principle is that of the uniqueness of Mexican immigration based on geography and history.  Six features differentiate Mexican immigration from other waves of past and present immigrant groups, thereby precluding comparison to historical precedent--a foundational tenet upon which Huntingtonian doctrine relies. <br />  <br />  These features include, 1) the ratio of geographical contiguity and economic disparity between the sending nation and the host nation, 2) the number and rate of immigration, 3) preponderant illegality of entrance and stay, 4) inter-state migrating pattern and formation of Mexican-only regional concentrations, 5) political and economic entente between sending nation and host nation, and 6) historical relevance that most southwest territory was previously under Mexican rule.  According to Huntington, these national facts about Mexican immigrants lessen the need, in theory, for Mexican immigrants to assimilate to American culture.  Huntington's contention is that because of national origin, the Mexican immigrant is less likely to adopt American values than other immigrant groups, regardless of the structural circumstance of the individual.    </p><p> <br /> 
The doctrine's second principle is the lack of incentive of Mexican immigrants to culturally assimilate compared to other immigrating groups into the U.S.  Huntington writes that "many Mexican-American immigrants simply do not appear to identify primarily with the United States" (Huntington, 2004).  Huntington claims that the two cultures are hardly compatible on many levels.  For example, Anglo-Protestant culture is very individualistic and Mexican culture is community-oriented.  Furthermore, Huntington asserts that career and ambition are high priorities of Anglo-Protestant culture, while family and leisure are prioritized in Mexican culture.  For this reason, the Mexican immigrant is not willing to assimilate to the lifestyle and cultural norms of the typical American.   <br />  <br />  
The indicators of lifestyle and American cultural norms are as follows: 1) Sole usage of the English language in public, 2) desire for high educational goals (especially among the youth), 3) continual desire for higher occupational goals (managerial positions), 4) continual desire for greater income, 5) intermarriage, 6) self-identification as American, 7) desire for naturalization and citizenship.    </p> <br /> 
<h3>Conclusion and the Threat of Inaction to Xenophobia and Racism</h3><p> <br /> 
According to the Huntingtonian doctrine, immigrants are less willing to pursue these goals than other immigrant groups.  The primary claim is the ethno-cultural difference between the national culture of Mexico and the national culture of the U.S.  For example, Samuel Huntington wrote, "the cultural division between Hispanics and Anglos could replace the racial division between blacks and whites as the most serious cleavage in U.S. society" (Huntington, 2004).  It is a controversial subject among political analysts to posit that cultures from certain ethnic groups have differing compatibility with American culture.  For example, South Asians (Indians, Bangladeshi, and Pakistanis) assimilate more quickly because their culture, through history, is more compatible with Anglo-Protestant culture.  Upon arrival, they are already highly fluent in English and are familiar with Anglo-Protestant culture because of British colonial influence (Kurlantzick, 2002).  The anti-science community depends on anecdotal information and examples to support its reasoning because fictive reasoning always passes for fact without a sound counter-narrative from opposing ideologies. This resounding voice of reason and science, however, is becoming silenced by the cutting of public social science funding for voices like the National Institutes of Health. And so as it is often headlined by the Washington Post, "Only in Silence Can Democracies Die."  </p>

<h2>How Social Networks Affect our Health </h2>
<p>Social determinants play a role in shaping our lifestyle habits, and in turn our health. Social determinants, networked as they are by our myriad and various influences, create an excellent opportunity to apply social network analysis with specific determinants of great interest and consequence. Although our primary social networks begin with our life-partners and our families, there is significant, and highly variable, influence from outside our nuclear families. </p>  <span id="toggle2">
Click to read more... <br /> </span>
<div  id="texthealth"><p> I speak on the social places of our work, the boards we serve on, our leisure activities, our places of worship, and so on. Those that we trust in our lives and those that trust us, we share information at varying levels of confidence and exclusivity for its value. These criteria begin to define what it is we call our social networks. And so this excerice is the the beginning of thinking in terms of of networking, measured by social capital, as a resource and at times detrimental object of exchange. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>I. Social network behavior. </h3><p>Information we learn from others through interaction and mimicry-observation is exemplified by what we learn in close contact, learned techniques of any activity. These are what we can generally call peer influence. Recent literature and advances in social network analysis have closely specified models that measure symmetry, content, structure, and other features that are reducible to quantitatve measure and analysis. Social capital indicators from observations, experimental or not, provide the content of analysis when we study social exchanges between between individuals (also called nodes) within a network. These exchanges help determine the jobs we find and choose, the food and drinks that we taste and partake, yet they also help us perceive and define "good" nutrition and "moderation". On choices of health, our social lives, our trusted social networks inform us which doctors, which insurance plans, and which pharmaceuticals "work best". Our future outlook on life, and other indicators of good mental health are linked to our social networks, according to research [Lin, Social Networks and Social Capital]. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>II. What determines health? Why and where. </h3><p>
We can tie in these social determinants to health outcomes that vary widely between states in America and between nations across the globe. Within first-world nations by GDP, there is surprising variability. So, why do some nations' citizens live longer and healthier? Is it because of the fish in the water in Norway, where the average life-span is above 80 years? Fishing and nutrition are a constant, however, Norwegians are living 7% longer in 2014 than 1990. So, is it advances in pharmaceutical science--whether preventative or ameliorative. It could be the air, yet we would be remiss to not look at their habits of lifestyle. Walking habits and other daily affairs are altered by social dynamics. If a quarter of the office regularly takes breaks to stand, stretch or walk around the block or a flight of stairs, then chances are the habit will catch on like a but to those least immune, and more succeptible to long-wished-for healthy habits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>III. Cultural diversity of social beliefs, norms, and behaviors:</h3><p>
 How can we qualitatively assess social networks and influencing dynamics that alter determination? What role do social networks and the dynamics of daily social lives look like? Could there be a difference in the manner that different nationalities and regions socialize and thus behave, especially as they age? We hear of vastly different social perspectives and practices around health between cultures, often easily categorized along Western versus Eastern cultures, and the valuing of individuality versus valuing of community. To this end, I cite vivid set of examples provided by Dr. Ziarat Hossein, of the University of New Mexico. His 2015 presentation, entitled ‚ÄúChanging Age Structure and Cultural Perspectives on Aging ‚Äì Contexts of Family and Care‚Äù analyzes varing views, exemplified by elder nuclear family members living with younger generations, or nursing home or worse, homelesssness. The work speaks of the cultural diversity of social beliefs, norms, and behaviors around aging, and that these cultural beliefs have ramifications for later living arrangements, responsibilities, and so on. Even the status in occupatonal networka and practices of hierarchy, mobility, and shared skills and multi-level technical training begins to redefine the roles along age lines--this is an open question for new and never-identified cases of agism in the workforce--surely a subject for another day, a rainy day maybe. Some face the challenge, as Sociologist Amy Whitfield's work on the generational differences and conceptions between the digital-native millenials, generation X, the baby boomer generation. And so looking around, there are profound differences along demographic terms around the globe from which each nation shares a common denominator--we as a species are living longer and healthier with new abilities that can be erroneously overlooked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IV. Identifying social networks:</h3><p>
 Case in point, Ethnic Enclaves of community-minded networking and disproportionately healthy birthrates. Given our purposes in this essay to identify the social determinants that perpetuate healthy outcomes, and often outcomes widely varying between groups. Our job is to scientifically and empirically quantify the patterns of these social influences of healthy living. Maybe the most palpable example in recent literature like "Ethnic Enclaves of community-minded networking and disproportionately healthy birthrates", by Drs. Theresa Osypuk, Linda Bates, and Dolores Acevedo-Garcia. They authoritatively write on the birthweight paradox and other specifically identifiable health outcomes that defy usual predictive models regarding Latinos--unusually healthy outcomes even within low-income families in low-resource neighborhoods. As a matter of fact, they found that residential ethnic enclaves, Mexican and other, improve birth outcomes. Why? because social capial and social networks offer women institutional or financial support (Portes and Rumbaut, 2006) during pregnancy; Look at the social networks and &lt;i&gt;social control&lt;/i&gt; among family and community expectations in the enclave. They reinforce norms regarding healthy behaviors and practices and sanctioned unhealthy ones. Never forget our colorful cigarette boxes and salad menu laws between New York City and rural Alabama. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>V. Measuring this phenomenon using social network analysis:</h3><p>
 Don't worry, it's only a brief 101 on Social network behavior. How ever to measure social determinants, as they live in networks, on healthy living? Our social networks vary in strength, in distance, in symmetry (for example, when trust is not reciprocated). Some of our networks are bunched together, others broaden and partially overlap other of ou many network, some are exclusive and span long-distant resources, and so on. We know about active networking activities such as professional or academic networking to access resources, yet there is also a passive role of social networks--the machinations of which we are often partially aware--whether or not we find our selves as a bridge between two large networks, we fill a communication gap and our own value and decision-making power increases--this occurs outside our control--an example of exogenous network forces that constantly change structure and alter present and future outcomes--sometimes one network reaches another network and information comes to light to alter even the past--this is the nature of the exogenous dynamics of the social determinants within our lives. </p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VI. Social networks better understood: Social Capital is an easy observation.</h3><p>
 In his influential book, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community (2000), Robert Putnam identified seven dimensions of social capital (political participation, civic participation, religious participation, workplace networks, informal networks, mutual trust, and altruism), and showed that there are two distinct, though not necessarily mutually exclusive, types of social capital: bridging social capital (inclusive, outward-looking social networks), and bonding social capital (exclusive, inward-looking social networks). In addition Putnam explored changes in social capital over the 20th century, demonstrating that social capital increased between 1900 and the 1960s, then decreased dramatically as a result of pressures of time and money, mobility and sprawl, television, and generational differences. No clearer examples could be made. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VII. So, we have come to an exciting discussion  </h3><p>
and agreement on this ubiquitous, yet hard-to-define social determinant that is both an active tool for accessing health resources and it is also the unconscious element of our psychological make-up by which we learn, we mimic behavior and vice versa we unknowlingly teach through our actions. So, what does the social scientist do about this quandary of needing to quantify a "determinant" of this sort, which language can scarcely qualify. The very first critical step as a scientist is to not overstep the bounds of accepted philosophical tenets of the nature of humans as social beings. Harvard Sociologist Stanley Lieberson, in his 1991 Presidential Address, remarked that social science can capitalize on the power of probabilistic methods when speaking about social determinants--so, we say that certain social conditions of X, Y, and Z, like poverty, social service retrenchment, etc., as specified within our theoretical model, alter the likelihood of differing outcomes. However, theoretical explanations of causality, such as the true science of vaccine risks, that involve a set of sequences toward determining an outcome is not useful if the probabilitilies in the model don't add up to 1.0. You know, I can't have a 40% chance of correctly calling heads, at the same time as having a 90% chance of correctly calling tails. So, we need to be careful and modest in how we speak of social determinants. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>VIII. With this powerful tool at our disposal, </h3><p>
and a profoundly complex understanding about networks, how might we interpret the patterns of our social relations? In scientific terms we say that we make an empirical generalization into a theoretical model with which we deduce two or three hypotheses about an observed or experimental evidence. Evidence, whether supportive or negative evidence, is rare that we gain very reliable knowledge. The exception is through use of frequent, small observations that over time accumulate to practice-based, policy-ready social science. (This is a call for more social science funding from the National Institutes of Health.) Public health advocates and researchers, criminologists and educational theorists refer to social capital in common and shared terms as a symbolic measurement, has popularized the term for its intuitive metaphorical value. The downside is that the term has diffused into multiple meanings and multiple levels of analysis, so that apples are beginning to compare to yellows and so forth. Thankfully, social science has broken through past this impasse so that criminology, sociology and public health disciplines are converging back to the same page. That page is the methodological convergence onto contemporary social network analysis (SNA) theory. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IX. Rest assured that social scientists are beleagured </h3><p>
 in their efforts to capture the evidence of highly variant phenomena, not only identify and correctly rule out alternate explanations, yet understand a phenomenon well enough to predict social behavior--whether that be shopping trends, hospital-capacity forecasting down the continuum to the community and neighborhood needs. And in today's online and fast-paced world, we want more and more to model the future. What will demographics entail for 2017, 2020, or even 2050? We can thank the sociologists in the fields of observation and statistical institutes that open our eyes to our constantly evolving societies.</p><br />

 <p>My academic interests center on the methodology of education research in K-12 and higher education. Specifically, I research post-secondary education's potential in creating life opportunities, or in some cases potential pitfalls. For example, data on college graduation rates (sourced from the National Center for Education Statistics' datasets on public, two-year community colleges) indicate an 81% 2-year-to-4-year transfer aspiration level among during students' first year. Yet, only 21% transfer within six years; this latter figure continues to decline, especially among low-income and first-generation college students. <br />
  In this age, many of the education problems cannot be solved without referring to historical precedent for guidance. For example, compare the social-cultural conditions of three case studies on national education reform--that is, 1807-1830's Prussian reforms on free public primary education, and the 1870-1880's French Jules Ferry reforms that inspired free secondary schooling. The third historical period--surrounding the U.S. Higher Education Act and Congressional Reauthorizations between 1964 and 1972--aims to understand a similar nationalized route toward affordable public education access, i.e., post-secondary schooling--a college education that is apt for a globally competitive, and diversified, labor market in last century's information-based Third Industrial Revolution. </p>
<p>My social-historical ethos, theoretically informed by Pierre Bourdieu's commitment to qualitative and quantitative research methods; further, social science must adhere to the tenets of reproducibility, metric validity, and actionable, scientific resolution. I use R Code and Stata programming to advance the precision and exponential power of statistical analysis, without ignoring the human-element through qualitative case-study research. Lastly, a little about myself: My family and nearly all of my descendants are from central and northern New Mexico. I was born in Idaho, spent my early childhood in Paris, France, and enjoyed residence in Idaho, New York, Texas and Albuquerque, NM. </p>
