abstract = {We compare Cuban, Puerto Rican, and Mexican origin adolescents’ desire to attend college and their per- ceived likelihood of attending college with those of non-Latino white and black adolescents. We find that the strength of college aspirations and expectations is high among all the groups, and that Mexican origin and Puerto Rican origin adolescents have weaker, while Cubans have stronger, aspirations and expectations than non-Latino whites. However, our findings demonstrate that the weaker college aspirations and expectations among Mexicans and the weaker expectations among Puerto Rican students are due to differences across groups in socioeconomic status, academic skill, and engagement in high school, while the stronger college aspirations and expectations of Cubans remain, even after adjusting for these measures. Furthermore, we find that parental education, family income, immigrant generation, and speaking English at home are not related to the strength of adolescents’ college aspirations and expectations in the same way across Latino groups.},

@article{Flashman2014,
abstract = {Racial disparities in achievement are a persistent fact of the US educational system. An often cited but rarely directly studied explanation for these disparities is that adolescents from different racial and ethnic backgrounds are exposed to different peers and have different friends. In this article I identify the impact of friends on racial and ethnic achievement disparities. Using data from Add Health and an instrumental variable approach, I show that the achievement characteristics of youths’ friends drive friend effects; adolescents with friends with higher grades are more likely to increase their grades compared to those with lower-achieving friends. Although these effects do not differ across race/ethnicity, given differences in friendship patterns, if black and Latino adolescents had friends with the achievement characteristics of white students, the GPA gap would be 17 to 19 percent smaller. Although modest, this effect represents an important and often overlooked source of difference among black and Latino youth.},

@article{Furstenberg2000,
abstract = {The 1990s saw considerable advances in the state of research on adolescence and youth. This article provides a critical commentary on a subset of this research, focusing on the causes and consequences of the lengthened period in which the transition to adulthood occurs. It provides a brief history of adolescence research, identifying a select set of topics, themes, and research problems that will guide research on adolescence and youth over the next decade. These research foci, which include peer group relations, biological influences on adolescence, employment experiences, increased autonomy, and racial and gender differences, are described as representing either continuities or advances in adolescence research. The strengths and shortcomings of this research are detailed. The paper concludes by suggesting promising areas for future research and by providing guidelines for undertaking such research.},

Although improvement in social background can accountfor part of the aggregate between-cohort increase in expectations, relative direct costs and labor market incentives are necessary to explain the remaining increase, why Black students' adjusted expectations were higher than White students', why White students' expectations increased more than did Black students', and why the expectations of Black students of both cohorts were more likely to increase between the sophomore and senior years of high school.},
