12.0pt;line-height:200%'>Legal and socio-economic explanations for the lag in
cultural assimilation within immigrant neighborhood enclaves remains divided
between 21<sup>st</sup> century sociology, based on economics-driven behavior,
versus the 1900’s-esque xenophobia of the Samuel Huntington doctrine, which
asserts “globalist” historical ethno-nationalism.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This blog discusses different legal and
socio-economic aspects faced by migrants upon arrival into the U.S. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I thus highlight these explanations for
contemporary cultural assimilation patterns in contrast to an increasingly well-defined
nationalist viewpoint, exemplified by the current White House administration’s legal
actions on immigration policy—a policy soon to be contested between the 9 recently-united
Supreme Court Justices. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:200%'>First, a word on the issues and the stakes of the modern
American immigration policy, and the science underpinning the debates. Social
science begins with the collection of individual data on immigrants’ ethnic
origins and their current legal and socio-economic circumstance. The opposing
view dismisses legal and socio-economic data, in favor of the argument that immigrant
behavior is <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>determined</i> by the immigrant’s
nation of origin, and thus genealogical roots and ethnic phenotype.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This latter view is a snapshot of the
post-Reconstruction, 1900’s-era American belief system – a view that predates
contemporary psychology of Skinner, the sociology of Bourdieu, and behavioral economics
of Milton Friedman.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since the era of
modern social science, structure-based immigrant behavior is, in a nutshell, operationalized
by two variables: legality of stay (as determined by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service) and socio-economic ability, i.e. structural needs,
wants, and goals, and is operationalized by occupational/income-earning power,
educational achievement, and expected duration of stay in the host
country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Unfortunately, scientific
data collection on migrants is made difficult by incognito behavior depending on
legality of stay and transience dependent on social-economics.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First, it is difficult to maintain a
statistically honest survey results without anonymity due to constant fear of
INS exposure. Second, scientific observation cannot keep current with the
constant legal and socio-economic flux of an immigrant with high-turnover of
residence address and occupation/income.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>AI technology and
the social media landscape does not resolve the fundamental hurdles faced by
the social science of immigrant assimilation. However, sociology of immigration
is the best hope to seal the casket on the 1900’s, post-Darwinist focus on
ethnic identity as the principle determinant of immigrants’ cultural
assimilation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoSubtitle style='line-height:200%'>Literature on the Immigration
Debate</p>

<h1 style='line-height:200%'>Propensity of Assimilation is Based on Ethnicity
vis-à-vis Huntington <span style='font-style:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<h1 style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span style='font-style:normal'>In
the past, U.S. immigration has been likened to the Tomato Soup analogy, that
is, tomatoes provide the substance, but immigration provides the herbs and
spice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All immigrants regardless of
origin and socio-economic circumstance find a niche in American society,
eventually adopting its culture over one or two generations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, Huntingtonian doctrine asserts an
exception to the rule:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mexican
immigration differs from past and present immigration trends.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The generalization is that certain ethnic
groups are less willing to culturally assimilate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>According to this theoretical viewpoint, the
ethnic identity and culture of the incoming Mexican immigrant repudiates, like
oil with water, fundamental aspects of American culture such as language,
values, and norms.<o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<h1 style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span style='font-style:normal'>For
this cause, Huntington predicts a potential bifurcation, again like oil with
water, of American society.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
predicted bilingual and bicultural division will ultimately lead to a
bicognitive American self-identity and culture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Unlike past immigrant groups,&quot; Huntington writes,
&quot;Mexicans and other Latinos have not assimilated into mainstream U.S.
culture, forming instead their own political and linguistic enclaves ... and
rejecting the Anglo-Protestant values that built the American dream”
(Huntington, 2004).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>Based on two principles of national origin, immigrants of Mexican
origin are less likely to culturally assimilate than other immigrant groups.
The</span> first principle is that of the uniqueness of Mexican immigration
based on geography and history.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Six
facts differentiate Mexican immigration from other waves of past and present
immigrant groups, thereby precluding comparison to historical precedent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'>These facts are, 1) the
ratio of geographical contiguity and economic disparity between the sending
nation and the host nation, 2) the number and rate of immigration, 3)
preponderant illegality of entrance and stay, 4) inter-state migrating pattern
and formation of Mexican-only regional concentrations, 5) political and
economic entente between sending nation and host nation, and 6) historical
relevance that most southwest territory was previously under Mexican rule.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>According to Huntington, these national facts
about Mexican immigrants lessen the <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>need,
in theory,</span> for Mexican immigrants to assimilate to American
culture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Huntington’s contention is that
because of national origin, the Mexican immigrant is less likely to adopt
American values than other immigrant groups, regardless of the structural
circumstance of the individual.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'>The second principle is the
lack of compatibility of Mexican immigrants to culturally assimilate compared
to other immigrating groups into the U.S.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Huntington writes that “many Mexican-American immigrants simply do not
appear to identify primarily with the United States” (Huntington, 2004).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Huntington claims that the two cultures are
hardly compatible on many levels.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
example, Anglo-Protestant culture is very individualistic and Mexican culture
is community-oriented.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore,
Huntington asserts that career and ambition are high priorities of
Anglo-Protestant culture, while family and leisure are prioritized in Mexican
culture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For this reason, the Mexican
immigrant is not willing to assimilate to the lifestyle and cultural norms of
the typical American.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'>The indicators of lifestyle
and American cultural norms are as follows: 1) Sole usage of the English
language in public, 2) desire for high educational goals (especially among the
youth), 3) continual desire for higher occupational goals (managerial
positions), 4) continual desire for greater income, 5) intermarriage, 6)
self-identification as American, 7) desire for naturalization and citizenship.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'>According to the
Huntingtonian doctrine, Mexican Americans are less willing to pursue these
goals than other immigrant groups.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
primary reason is the ethno-cultural difference between the national culture of
Mexico and the national culture of the U.S.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For example, Samuel Huntington writes, &quot;the cultural division
between Hispanics and Anglos could replace the racial division between blacks
and whites as the most serious cleavage in U.S. society&quot; (Huntington,
2004).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is a common subject among
political analysts that cultures from certain ethnic groups have differing <span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>compatibility</span> with American
culture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For example, South Asians
(Indians, Bangladeshi, and Pakistanis) assimilate more quickly because their
culture, through history, is more compatible with Anglo-Protestant
culture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Upon arrival, they are already
highly fluent in English and are familiar with Anglo-Protestant culture because
of British colonial influence (Kurlantzick, 2002).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Socio-Economic
Status as Component of Structural Circumstance</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Current U.S.
immigrants arrive with very disparate legal and socio-economic
circumstances.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These two indicators of
structural circumstance determine the course of the immigrants’ stay.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Accordingly, they determine the pattern of
cultural assimilation for each immigrant and their ability to attain the same
status and culture as the typical, middle-class American (Suarez-Orozco,
2000).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cultural assimilation follows
hand-in-hand with upward career mobility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>“[Assimilation] is the cumulative byproduct of choices made by
individuals seeking to take advantage of opportunities to improve their social
situations” (Alba, 1995).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Interestingly, the
current immigrant arrives in an economic job market that is highly
segregated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Using an hourglass metaphor,
there is either “a well-remunerated, knowledge-intensive economic sphere [or] a
service economy where low-skilled and semi-skilled workers continue to lose
ground in terms of real wages, benefits, and security. Therefore immigrants
fall into one or the other labor market” (Suarez-Orozco, 2000). It follows that
immigrant groups are statistically divided along the same line as the economic
and educational development of the nation of origin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The U.S. immigrant
from any national origin falls into two very different structural categories
upon arrival.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They range from highly
skilled to unskilled and poorly educated, These circumstances strongly affect
the immigrant experience and subsequent pattern of assimilation (Portes and
Rumbaut, 1996). The lesser-skilled workers have the only choice of accepting
jobs that offer no upward mobility and their housing is forced into urban,
ethnically segregated neighborhoods.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
highly skilled workers, with their education and language ability, are offered
jobs that support a work and residence lifestyle that involves interaction with
middle-class America, while at the same time prospering cultural
assimilation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For this reason, Portes
and Rumbaut (2001) identify two prominent types of immigrant assimilation. The
first type is able to adopt mainstream American customs, speaks English, and is
upwardly mobile within one or two generations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The second type, based on socio-economic circumstances, acculturates to
inner-city subcultures, low education level and labor market, even after
several generations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<h1 style='line-height:200%'>Expectation of Stay and Legality as Component of
Structural Constraint </h1>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:200%'>In the past, immigrants had
few opportunities to communicate, visit, or even return to the sending nation,
thereby facilitating the process of cultural assimilation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Expected length of stay and naturalization of
the immigrant in the host nation is an essential element in the immigrant’s
desire to assimilate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the immigrant
plans to stay temporarily in the host nation, there is less need to learn the
culture of the host nation (Guarnizo, 2003).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For example, one in five Mexican immigrants will choose to acquire
American citizenship (Chavez, 1998).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Guarnizo says that propensity to engage in entrepreneurial ventures
varies systematically with the socially-expected duration (SED) of
migration.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In other words, temporary
SED’s<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>“preserve ties with the country
and community of origin.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, SED
is primarily affected by legality of stay and the option to naturalize.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whether the immigrant works illegally, holds
a temporary worker visa or is naturalized has a tremendous impact on the
immigrant’s SED. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Because of mass
transportation, transnationalism has revolutionized the concept of the
immigration process by invalidating the traditional “clean break” assumption
globalized communication and information technologies immigrants are no longer
tied to one country (Suarez-Orozco, 2000).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Furthermore, developing nations support dual-nationality in order to
encourage monetary remittances from former emigrants temporarily residing in
other nations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Developed nations
encourage temporary worker immigrants in order to fill gaps in labor
market.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These factors affect both the
expectation of stay and the legality question among immigrants into the United
States.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bottom line is that
immigrants that stay temporarily or expect to be deported for legal reasons are
not likely to assimilate into American culture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>
