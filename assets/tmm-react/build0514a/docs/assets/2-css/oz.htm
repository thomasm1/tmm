<h3>An excerpt from The Wizard of OZ</h3>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<h1>The Cyclone</h1>

<p>From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also.
</p>

<p>Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.</p>

<p>"There's a cyclone coming, Em," he called to his wife. "I'll go look after the stock." Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept.
</p>

<p>Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of the danger close at hand.</p>

<p>"Quick, Dorothy!" she screamed. "Run for the cellar!"</p>
