				</h6>
				<p>-Lady Gaga</p><br />
			<p class="firstparagraph"><strong>Creators in the Digital Age</strong>, especially Musicians, have faced just a panoply of business model challenges, notably since the 2000s' <i>Napster Era</i>.  And yet, this is the age-old-case of new technologies reshaping long-standing fields, especially financial structure - the bottom line!  All creative fields also have technological features on the horizon that may, potentially move the playing field. First some recent background: </p>
			<p class="quote">
	While [Taylor Swift] is certainly making money in retail sales and digital downloads, both of those metrics are spiraling downward as people migrate away from the concept of owning music at all. Nielsen recently released numbers indicating substantial drops in both CD and digital-track sales, which are down almost $100 million <i>year over year</i> from 2014; streaming music continues to grow, but the revenue it generates isn’t close to making up the difference, yet.<sup>1</sup>
			</p><p>Most remember Taylor Swift's 2014 industry-shaking album withdraw in protest to Spotify's payment structure. The next year Taylor took on Apple iTunes--to which Apple bended to Taylor's Way<sup>2</sup>. These   wins are amazing but not enough, if only for winning battles in a losing war. </p>
			<p class="quote">Spotify is the future. Spotify is the enemy. Spotify doesn’t pay enough. Spotify is music’s best bet for revenue growth. Since it arrived in the United States from Sweden in 2011, Spotify has been cast as both hero and villain in the music industry’s continuing debate over streaming music. 	</p>
			<p class="quote"> 
		It has been hailed as a potential savior through a two-tiered “freemium” model that would gradually lure listeners away from piracy. Yet Spotify’s royalty rates have also terrified many artists already worried that each new step in music’s digital evolution further devalues their work.<sup>3</sup></p>
			<p>So the trend looks dire, and yet is it really? Where, just where are the <strong>Tech Platforms </strong> leading us?  Tech is leading us <i>nowhere</i>, at least not to one <strong>singular, centralized place</strong>; rather, decentralized tech--including but not limited to blockchain--is busy rewriting the boundaries between creators and consumers. This Tuesday's Forbes article reported on new subscription-based model by Patreon. Still classical Web 2.0, it's novelty appears so simple, almost intuitive in potentially new pathway:</p>
			<p class="quote">"On Kickstarter and Indiegogo, creators essentially have to start over every time," says Danny Rimer, a partner at Index Ventures who is a Patreon investor and board member. "It's the same reason software companies went from licensed software to subscriptions: predictable revenue and better service for customers."<sup>4</sup></p>
			<p>
				Apparently Patreon, along with last November's <i>Drip</i> by KickStarter have made headway. Patreon paid out $150 million to its artists in 2017, and each are doubling annually. Decentralizing again. Well, we say we can't <i>go back to the way it was</i>, but Tech always seems to lead us back to the way it was!

	<p class="  author">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>

	<h6 class="  chapternumber">March 14, 2018</h6>

	<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber"><i>Tou <strong>Demou</strong> tes <strong> Krates</strong></i>:<br />Strength of the People</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Today's demonstrations and walk-outs, led by America's Youth and followed by many of the education staff, has aimed directly at Gun-Control legislation.  Yet, the message more powerfully articulated than ever by adolescent-turns-adult students, takes aim at something further afield. </p><p>Students, remembering the February 14th massacre victims,   take aim at the corruption stemming  from the 2010 Supreme Court "Person-hood" protection for Corporations, also known as the <i>Citizens United</i> Decision. A dated, but poignant, article from National Public Radio explains: 
	</p>
	<p class="quote">The Supreme Court extended that protection to corporations, and over time also extended some — but not all — of the rights guaranteed to individuals in the Bill of Rights.<sup>1</sup> 
	</p><p>
		Yet, it appears deceptively harmless for Congressional Law-makers to protect corporations, in the form of <strong>Gun Manufacturers' Lobbyists, 	</strong>  
		as equally as it protects humans. The origin or this ruling dates to a 70's Neo-Liberal, right-leaning legislation and Court rulings that include a pivotal 1978 <i>First National Bank of Boston v. Belloti</i> decision allowing for corporations' ballot-initiative campaign contributions, citing the First Amendment.<sup>2</sup>

				The Result? The corporation, in "person" form, takes on Pseudo-Human qualities: immortal, beyond-measure capital, and programmatically serving stock-holders' interests with cut-throat competition at all costs. No match against a sympathetic human, yet the Corporation is given the same rights and privileges as the man in the street. Now, in the face of two decades' dead humans--as young as <i>Sandy Hook Elementary</i>, which were not protected by Legislation, due to commitments made to corporate lobbying.

	<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:<br /> Part III and Sustainability of Shared, Distributed Ledger Types</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">March 13th, 2018 marks the day that certain types of blockchain technologies, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum, face an existential crisis: Today, a new distributed ledger technology has been announced, which departs from the traditional "Proof-of-Work" (energy-intensive calculations) Blockchain technologies. 
    This is critically important to zero carbon-footprint. For example, Bitcoin calculations drain more energy, 50 TeraWatt/hrs per year--higher than Singapore's 49.8!</p><p>Next, the primary security flaw of consensus-based leadership like Ripple, Iota (as opposed to <i>random-selection blockchain leadership</i> based on   carbon-intensive calculations) is they are susceptible to Hacking: Denial-of-Service Attacks are possible because the next leader Block can be anticipated and followed by a Bot), so the blockchain cycle is attacked at every cycle.  </p><p>The Heder Hashgraph unveiled today overcomes this problem by using a 39-node-leader hashgraph data structure. Interestingly, this is based on the original Visa Credit Card design from the 1950's (then called AmericaBank) for authenticating system.  </p><p>
		Next, The Heder Hashgraph overcomes the problem of "fairness" because blockchain transactions are <i><strong>not ordered in each cycle</strong>.</i>  Bitcoin transactions  are haphazardly lumped together in each block-cycle, which is ~12 minutes. Which means that time-sensitive financial data queries will always lose! </p><p>
	Swirld's unveiled their consensus-based <strong>Hashgraph, a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT),</strong> last year. Today, it has
    now been announced to deploy in late 2018 on the Hedera Hashgraph public network. This is tremendous news! Tremendous, since I explained in my <a href="#18-03-01">March 1st </a> blog post that older blockchain technologies incentivize miners' efforts by directly tying electrical-cost( (in calculations) to the Bitcoin/hour profit margin. For this reason, the future horizon just considerably shortened Bitcoin's runway for establishing anything beyond "early-adopter" status. </p><p>So, we'll see if the innovating crew with Vitalik Buterin's Ethereum can successfully alter the crypto algorithm into it's planned carbon-free consensus-based, "proof-of-stake" form. For the moment, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other electricity-draining "proof-of-work" designs, have their <strong>exchange value  trapped inside their own Carbon Footprint</strong>.<sup>4</sup> And so, because environmental sustainablity is foremost of concerns for future investment, survival may depend on digging out of that Carbon Footprint much more quickly!</p>

	<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:<br /> Part II and New Forms of Trust</h6>
<p class="firstparagraph">
    Throughout the centralized-tech period of the <i>mobile-powered </i> Web 2.0, most Sharing transactions take place on
    a centralized platform that simply facilitates the peer-to-peer transactions. However, the trust is based on some third-party authority. For instance, 
    Uber serves as the centralalized, third-party authority between both consumers (whether resource-obtaining or resource-providing) must place their trust. Similarly, centralized authorities like Paypal, etc. enable peer-to-peer collaboration. Yet, 
    the notion of trust remains unsolved: Both parties must place their faith in the third party. By definition, this problem that undermines the <i>Sharing Economy</i> is resolved by Blockchain technologies, through cryptography. Now, Decentralized Apps (DAPPS) provide a truer sharing platform for value transactions.  
</p>
	<p>In short, neither peer, <strong>neither consumer needs to be trusted, because both parties share a mutual trust in their shared ledger</strong> (think of a thick book with an indexed log of each and every transaction, with unchangeable entries etched by cryptography. In this fashion the forms of Exchange Value include: <br />
	1. Value Funds &amp; Investments<br />
	2. Immutable Insurance &amp; Risk Management<br />
	3. Account for &amp; Audit Commodified Value 
    4. Authenticate &amp; Attest to Value<br />
	5. Transfer, Store, Lend Value <br /></p>

	<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">The Sharing Economy Hand-in-Hand with the Market Economy:<br /> Part I and the Race for Sustainability Solutions</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Sharing can be a philosophy and even an ideology, but it is also  <strong> a concept sewn into the Technology of the Era</strong>. Sharing economy refers to both democratized peer-to-peer marketplaces, <i>and</i> collaborative, resource-circulating consumption systems where the consumer&#39;s role is provider or obtainer of resources. By either sense, the <i>Uberized</i> economy is made possible by the underlying platform of Decentralized Technologies. Mobile social media, internet, and blockchain tech creates the conditions needed for a convenient, community-based transactions.</p>

	<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum crypto-contracts grab the headlines, however it is the very nature of blockchain&#39;s <i>distributed, i.e. shared, </i>ledger that revolutionizes how humans interact, and how they exchange and share goods and services. So, how might a transactional, zero-sum Market Economy merge with a Sharing Economy?</p>

	<p>In <i>The Third Industrial Revolution, </i>Social and Economic theorist, Dr. Jeremy Rifkin, provides insight into how the <strong>Sharing Economy can grow alongside the traditional Market Economy</strong>. <sup>1</sup> The theory argues three (3)  breakthroughs are needed to create the conditions necessary for a new &quot;general purpose technological platform,&quot; and thus an Industrial Revolution. They are management/commmunication of power, sources of new power/energy, and the transportation of this power.</p>

	<p>The first condition: New forms of communication to <i>manage</i> power, for example steam-powered printing press, trans-oceanic telegraph, then later telephone. The second condition: New energy sources, for example steam-engine using coal and other fossil fuels. The third condition: New methods to transport energy, i.e. the steam engine on rails, then later fossil fuel vehicles.</p>

	<p>So what&#39;s new about today? 5G Cellular technology coupled with decentralized, blockchain internet; Second, improving solar &amp; wind power coupled with decentralized, bi-directional energy grid; and third, transporation by automatated, driverless shipping for example. So, why is this important, even vital to adapt a new paradigm that fits the new technology? exponential populstion growth and exponential climate changes are top of the list.</p>

	<p>Britain&#39;s innovations with steam &amp; coal characterized the first Industrial Revolution, and America&#39;s innovations in telephones, oil-fueled vehicles, and centralized transportation grid, however the innovations in the present era are much quicker than previous eras... which means we as a society can embrace more proactively the New Paradigm needed to adapt.</p>

	<p>So, how can we change the way we <i>think</i> and how we <i>react</i> depends on our worldview, and how deeply entrenched. Thomas Kuhn&#39;s 2004 publication on <strong><i>The Structure of Scientific Revolution</i></strong> <sup>3</sup> explains how society will drag its feet in the face of change, and only after decades of controversy will a New Paradigm Shift emerge. In this occasion however, we as a society may not have the luxury of decades to adapt to New Technologies, as the carbon hangover from the previous Industrial Era imperils the safe arrival of the next!</p>

	<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">1.4 Million Reasons for More Women in Tech, Part II<br />
	<br />
	* Continuation of Women in Tech Theme from <a href="#18-02-23">Feb. 23rd Blog</a></h6>

	<p class="quote">This is the first time in human history that we have the ability to see enough about ourselves that we can hope to actually build social systems that work qualitatively better than the systems we&#39;ve always had.</p>

	<p class="quote">--Author unknown</p>

	<p class="firstparagraph">My February 23rd Post on women in tech focused on the <i>workforce demand</i> for more women in tech positions, however today I&#39;m writing on the  <strong> <i>social need</i> for more female insight within the tech workforce</strong> , given that programming will increasingly shape our future institutions. This means that every institution, whether private hospitals, non-profit charity foundations, or government bureaus, will effectively restructure (optimize) their own organizational structure in an increasingly <i>data-driven</i> paradigm. From a Sociology of Organizations perspective, the changes to come are breath-taking to consider.</p>

	<p>So why women? Where could I start? Better stated, why is a quintessentially important job sector, a sector in desperate need for insight, comprised primarily of men? <sup id="one">1</sup> The facts are evident: ~15-20% of women comprising tech positions. <sup id="two">2</sup> Numbers aside, I argue there is a quintessential societal need for more women in tech: This is because computing and understanding data has changed since the data collection from Web 2.0 (mobile), becoming more networked and relational.</p>

	<p>The challenge for society in this age is historic, and women must absolutely be included in the process of the age: Please consider, that in the 1650&#39;s, the invention of the microscope opened a new world of data and <i>information</i> about the bacteriological, microscopic surroundings--hitherto blind to all. Likewise, the telescope has allowed us as a society to explore the outer universe and earth&#39;s position within it.</p>

	<p>Now, the inventions of machine-learning, computing coupled with Big Data analytics, allows us to explore (and manage) a universe of knowledge--about <i>ourselves</i>, human society--with unfathomably complex, unstructured relational data structures. Accessing the data to computer-readable form is one thing, but meaning in data is inaccessible until the <i>output</i> can be <i>re-</i>programmed into meaningful, human-readable data, i.e. information. This latter stage of development is the key challenge--for which success depends on representative female participation in Tech.</p>

	<p>Adding to the challenge of finding meaningful trends is the backdrop of noise from spurious variables. This is akin to finding a needle in an increasingly complex and growing haystack.</p>

	<p class="quote">What&#39;s different now and has changed is it&#39;s no longer about taking this data, putting it into a computer running a calculation and getting a balance sheet answer ...</p>

	<p class="quote">What&#39;s important now is what is the context of the data, what is it connected to, what effect is it having on data around it... It&#39;s basically a network of the data, it&#39;s no longer sort of tabular columns, of rows of data, it&#39;s <i>interconnected patterns</i>.<br />
	--Tim Cook</p>
 
	<p>This quote means that as we move away from rule-based, mechanistic data analytics toward more complex, relational and networked data, we need an equally complex paradigm to keep up. Excluding the female mind from this challenge is not simply a clumsy, myopic mistake. Worse yet, so long as the Tech Industry remains gender lop-sided, Tech will increasingly resemble another myopic beast, a cave-dweller named Cyclops.</p>

	<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">April 23 Implementation of the FCC Net Neutrality Laws:<br />
	The Coming Battle of States&#39; versus Federal Rights</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Net Neutrality Rules, potentially one of the more important set of Individual Rights for us as citizens in the tech age, will soon undergo the rule changes voted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) this past December. In a nutshell, the Internet Service Providers (ISP&#39;s), e.g. Comcast, Cox, Verizon are granted the power--as a Title I &quot;information service&quot;--to slow down traffic, make fast- &amp; slow-lanes. Of course this is bad news for internet-users because even premium users may experience &quot;throttling&quot; if using the ISP&#39;s preferred apps. The only stipulation holds that the ISP&#39;s rules are made public. However, 21 states are bringing lawsuits to fight these changes, and the first assertion of State Law by Washington State today:</p>

	<p class="quote">The FCC is already embroiled in a variety of lawsuits related to its rollback of net neutrality rules, including an effort from 21 state attorneys general to get a court to block the FCC&#39;s move.</p>

	<p class="quote">&quot;This is symbolic politics, because the states know it is illegal to do,&quot; Roslyn Layton, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told NBC News. &quot;But they can put rules on the book and make it look like they&#39;re doing something.&quot; The FCC is already embroiled in a variety of lawsuits related to its rollback of net neutrality rules, including an effort from 21 state attorneys general to get a court to block the FCC&#39;s move. <sup>1</sup></p>

	<p>S The big question arises over <i>who</i> has jurisdiction between the States&#39; and Federal authority; yet one thing is certain, the coming battle for protecting citizens&#39; rights will take place over jurisdiction of Internet Bandwidth turf.</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber">March 5, 2018</h6>

	<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel: Part II and the Germs</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Germs present a timely topic for today, given the especially virulent <strong>Flu Virus strain</strong>. Many, like me, have wondered why our 1940&#39;s-era <sup>1</sup> technology in Flu Vaccine fabrication wouldn&#39;t invite more innovative solutions. Without feigning any medical expertise, I have to still ask about the progress made with the ever-mutating--i.e., drifting--Flu virus&#39; surface protein &quot;head,&quot; called hemaglutinin. This strategy &quot;guesses right&quot; very effectively, and provides an effective solution for most, in most years. Yet this winter has revealed that effectiveness statistics are <i>not always</i> in our favor.</p>

	<p class="quote">For many decades, researchers believed the flu vaccine offered solid protection if it was a good match to the circulating strains; studies from the 1940s through the 1960s routinely showed an efficacy of 70% to 90%. But those studies relied on a misleading methodology.</p>

	<p class="quote">Danuta Skowronski, an epidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver, Canada, instead blames mutations in the vaccine strain itself. The most common influenza vaccine contains an &quot;inactivated&quot; virus, which manufacturers grow in chicken eggs. As Skowronski&#39;s team first reported in 2014, the virus can mutate while it is growing in the eggs, resulting in a vaccine unable to block circulating strains. <sup>1</sup></p>

	<p>Earlier, I casually mentioned &quot;guessing&quot;, yet with great respect, the science behind estimating the flu virus between the time of R &amp; D, fabrication, and the flu <i>season</i>. (This antigenic drift, not to be confused with <i>Antigenic Shift</i> in which the Flu Virus makes an abrupt change.) I&#39;ll let the CDC abbreviate this:</p>

	<p class="quote">One way they change is called &ldquo;antigenic drift.&rdquo; These are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses that happen continually over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that are pretty closely related to one another, which can be illustrated by their location close together on a phylogenetic tree. Viruses that are closely related to each other usually share the same antigenic properties and an immune system exposed to an similar virus will usually recognize it and respond <sup>2</sup>.</p>

	<p>So, ultimately, the strategy is to estimate the form, location, of that virus--what it will look like--at a particular period each year. This implicates a strategy to estimate the trajectory, stage by stage, of this virus, i.e. a longitudinal time-series morphology, each year. The article makes this point more precise:</p>

	<p class="quote">But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different (further away on the phylogenetic tree). When this happens, the body&rsquo;s immune system may not recognize those viruses. <sup>2</sup></p>

	<p>Petri dishes aside, let&#39;s focus on the changing nature of the Flu Virus, which makes itself a <i>research </i>challenge in itself because of an ever-mutating object of study. Yet, this ever-changing nature also provides the very tool Statisticians need most for estimating: Big Data. The Law of Large Numbers means that plain math can accurately plot, and in most cases predict with a moderate statistical significance, future events, sort of.</p>

	<p>Sort of I say because too often we predict that two separate events are more likely to occur, conditional on each other, then conditional upon other factors. This being <i>correlation</i>, but the Statistician&#39;s Holy Grail is the other kind: Causality. Causality hinges on only thre3e things: 1) Association, 2) Time Precedence, and 3) Ruling out any <i> effect</i> of spurious variables. (Hang with me, I&#39;m still getting back to the subject of our annual predictions about a few months&#39; worth of antigenic drift.)</p>

	<p>Therefore, Big data, and new advances in the statistical sciences, and the technology that increasingly defines our sciences, may soon refine and supercharge research into the first and third of the three points of causality. The first of these, the associations, along the phylogenetic tree, are merely a network at its base, the science of which gains computational strength each year. Rare as it is in Academia, in this case Might makes Right!</p>

	<p> 
	The third tenet of causality, after association and time direction, is ruling out the effect of other factors when separating <i>cause</i> and consequence. Advances in managing big data, and statistical analysis of it, means gaining a better handle on the multiple effects of <sup>spurious </sup>factors, hence analysis optimized by new, network-graph data structure technology. The Law of Large Numbers <sup>3</sup>, i.e. the sheer number of mutations and other factors, coupled with new <strong>technology</strong>, will better inform the morphology of the <i>path</i> of the virus, along the phylogenetic tree itself. Who knows where a cure may come from, perhaps a bio-statistician out there, churning the numbers, may be the one to stumble upon a better Flu Vaccine!

	<h6 class="dailytitle chapternumber">A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Back in 1997, a Pulitzer-Prize winning theory--based on Dr. Jared Diamond&#39;s <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies</i> --provided the recipe book for the success of societies. Not without controversy, the theory posits that geographic and environmental preconditions, once met, provide tech &amp; resources trading opportunities, within a network of other nation-states also vying for technogical innovation.</p>

	<p>A nation&#39;s Technology, in turn, opens the means necessary to expansive, stable, independent sovereignty that lasts and thrives. Equally so, the nation&#39;s friends, especially those making the best-friends list, share and receive a secondary, &quot;residual&quot; technological bump over the time-course of the network&#39;s future trading, i.e. network transactions. So, if our best friends Canada and Mexico are less keen, then there is network reverberation!</p>

	<p>Given the advent of a real, lasting Trade-War, I would think that a network theorist wouldn&#39;t be betting on one particular node within this network. I say this because a disproportionately asymmetrical flow of technology and resources, while simultaneously raising prices on most staple goods, may spell trouble for the Every-Day person. So far, Nation-State: 0, People: 0 ... So, who wins with a Trade War? Alas, let&#39;s hope not the resurrection of the Neo-Multi-National Corporations, born from NAFTA deals, coincidentally, from the late 1990&#39;s. Bah humbug!</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Widening Circles of Mobile-App Security Risks</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Security, security, another day another platform risk, or risks from your device, or risks from transactions, Today&#39;s headline buried beneath a techy jargon provides a glimpse of the rising threat of web-application-based hackery: Cryptojacking. <i>Coindesk</i> reports, &quot; Opera browser introduces cryptocurrency miner protection for smartphones ... &quot;</p>

	<p class="quote">Cryptocurrency miners can overload smartphones&#39; CPUs, forcing 100 percent usage and potentially causing a phone to overheat. And the damage can sometimes be permanent. According to a ZDNet article, one trojan generated so much heat in a phone, its battery became swollen, permanently damaging the phone. While excessive ads were one reason for the heat generation, the main cause was that the phone&#39;s CPU was hijacked to mine for Monero. <sup>1</sup></p>

	<p>The larger issue here is that the lines between trusted mobile-app authorities, i.e., certified by Play Store or Apple&#39;s is increasingly irrelevent. This is because an increasing number of app-users are ditching device-downloaded apps, preferring for browser applications--hence, a much more appetizing market for the newest generation of blackhat hackers, online thieves, peeping-toms, and other ill-wishers. There are a few driving factors for this issue--one of which is the onset of Decentralized Applications (DAPPs), which use the <i>browser</i> to interface between the Every-Day blockchain client/merchant/programmer and the actual byte-code of the blockchain (via WEB).</p>

	<p>More importantly, the larger issue is that we live in an age in which the exclusive, native browser language since 1995, i.e. JavaScript. Security issues with browser-based apps were very low, because JavaScript never left the browser, ever. Until 2009, Data, Servers were the domain of PHP, JAVA, Python, etc. or some other language for the highly sensitive, dirty work of dipping into all that data sitting ontop of centralized servers around the world. PHP wasn&#39;t easy, so power and responsibility usually followed with all the extra effort and expertise.</p>

	<p>2015 augured in the Node.js server-accessing (can create, read, update, and delete date) new-born capabilities of JavaScript</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Blockchain Sustainability Issues and The Double-Edged Sword</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">I couldn&#39;t help but revisit the <strong>Environmental Sustainability</strong> problem I addressed in my February 28th post. This problem, experienced by the top two crypto-currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that the <i>monetary</i> value of the currency is matched to the <i>computing difficulty</i>--measured either by how much the computer is sweating, or by electricity KiloWatt Hours per year. <sup>1</sup> Digiconomist succinctly writes:</p>

	<p class="quote">The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining can provide a solid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get a piece of it. Over the years this has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network to grow to epic proportions, as the price of the currency reached new highs. <sup>2</sup></p>

	<p>And, so the issue I&#39;m addressing is a side-effect of the deepening incentivization for miners to invest more equipment, and in turn, more electricity. The article goes on to report Bitcoin&#39;s surpassing 50 TeraWatt-Hours-per-year usage has surpassed that of Portugal and Singapore, which are 49.5 TWh per year, and 49.8 TWh per year, respectively. In other words, the usage by the Bitcoin miner&#39;s cost (in electricity) compared with the miner&#39;s gain (in Bitcoins accrued by incentivized mining) drives up and incentives a deeper Carbon Footprint.</p>

 
	<p class="quote">Fueled by a meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price over the past few months, the power usage of the Bitcoin network has been increasing at a feverish pace. Just a little over three months ago, at the start of November 2017, the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index was estimating the total electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network to be half of the current amount. On the first day of November, the estimated consumption was equal to 24.3 TWh per year. <sup>1</sup></p>

	<p> 
	Carbon Footprint, measured in this way, equates as a double-edged sword: The miner&#39;s electricity costs account for approximately 65% of the profit (Bitcoin units&#39; value, measured when mined). So the <i>economic </i>usage means the cheapest available fuel is part of the business model--and it would lead to the cost of the cheapest source of energy: Dirty Coal. At the end of the day, if the <i>currency&#39;s </i>rising value means that more computationally-intensive mining is more and more profitable, then perhaps the other edge looks preferred!

	<p class="author">by Thomas Maestas, MA</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber">Feb 10, 2018</h6>

	<h6>First Blog Post!</h6>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Why are Sociologists now the Key Players in Data Analysis within the Domain of Blockchain Technologies?</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">First, let me describe that blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming technology (peer-to-peer global ip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional, corporate, individual needs and uses. These blockchain &quot;network&quot; analyses depend on highly variable--and simultaneous--network changes, node changes, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily change interdependantly or not.</p>

	<p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships) that include arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Secondly, blockchain tech must face analytical challenges that arise from informal practices <sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from the employee role&#39;s protocol for the sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human factors.</p>

	<p>Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan&#39;s (1977) <i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple <i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time, convenience, etc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood, non-algorithm human understanding <i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors of a bank, a person, or a company&#39;s internal bot?</p>

	<p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly brought the world the blockchain tool, for which the Hard Sciences can only contribute little on how to interface with social needs. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers understand the multi-dimensional layers of hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship networks? Well enough to differentiate qualitative meaning in the smart-contract? Fearfully, no.</p>

	<p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved, integrated through multiple layers of &quot;middlemen&quot;, such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government institutions, non-governmental, non-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very nature, erases the middlemen. Suddenly, one programmer, for example, is writing the same healthcare insurance crypto-contract, that last month an entire team of hospital employees spent a month writing; then overseeing and managing different facets of this same thing.</p>

	<p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for the life of the contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years&#39; Sociology Network Analysts&#39; research and analytical development. Therefore, medical and other social fields cannot and should not turn to the Hard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers are already at home, safe within the academic domain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public Health, and so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology can either be defined by unwitting, piecemeal advances, accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises. Or, the next ten years can follow Sociology&#39;s Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful future.</p>

	<p>Examples aside, the primacy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on review of the Sociologists&#39; specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships, within social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values of those same relationships. We Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network mappings that appear arbitrary, yet are characterized by fixed patterns.</p>

	<p>No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes that characterize societal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of Large Number Statistical Theory become consumated with the brilliance of early 1900&#39;s Sociological French Network Theories, like Maurice Halbswach&#39;s work on the clearly defined network patterns of a society&#39;s Collective Memory.</p>

	<p>No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic&#39;s &quot;irrational behaviors&quot; and Mathematical &quot;complexity models&quot; do not <i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate simultaneous node changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs /or/ only 3 of 15 network groups get jobs), and most importantly the <i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across time and fixed.</p>

	<p>Fine. So, why is Sociology&#39;s network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from 19th and 20th centuries&#39; network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social era, while North American Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960&#39;s [post-1968], U.S. in the 1990&#39;s[post-1999], in the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns of past sociology are inherently small-data and more qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology incorporates &quot;human-ness&quot; into the billion rows and columns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>

	<p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction, and conditions of each relationship (link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or alter-link changes or is changed; with this, it is possible to isolate directional, conditional <i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation <sup id="9one">2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus on social networks.</p>

	<p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person <i>self-selects </i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the group&#39;s behavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates the group&#39;s behavior, by the group&#39;s influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder&#39;s SIENA software, achieves the impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize blockchain technology. The network graph can be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e, the blockchain in its entirety without hard forks), not as personal (egocentered) networks: Using this SIENA model allows for the necessary assumptions that a set of nodes (social actors) is given, and all ties (links) between these nodes are known - except perhaps for a moderate amount of missing data</p>

	<p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear, directed path of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists are called upon, blockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over again the same bugs. Sadly, this semi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt to use blockchain for their currency, contract, and other societal needs--in this case, the blind will indeed lead the blind.</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">How Can We Best Modularize our App Designs in Order to Achieve the Much Vaunted &quot;Separation of Concerns&quot;?</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed Order of Coders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style from structural design. Hence, in the early 2000&#39;s, a tri-partite, sensible world guided every web coder to abide by The scaffolding of HTML, functionality of JavaScript, and styling of CSS. A decade later, we must throw out this antiquated division of labor within web coding.</p>

	<p>Library modularization, (think JQuery, JSX, Bootstrap, etc.) within Javascript ES16 reveals that modules and components Must hold together CSS/HTML/JS, part by part. So, if a decade ago three teams handled html, js, css, it is now requisite to divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel widget, a team for the navigation widgets, and <i> each</i> of these component teams <strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module&#39;s required html, js, css.</p>

	<p>This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and all coding will necessarily begin to &#39;reinvent the wheel.&#39; This is because any module, any library you go to, will <i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to extricate new css from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite eventual misery, almost instantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p>

	<p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then? It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher level of abstraction, leaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice in the modern world, and if ad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is creativity? If yesterday&#39;s craft was the hoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New Art of modular coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part by part, module by module, the modern coder open-source window-browses and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and pastes, and folds and clips, then assembles and hangs to dry. Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module definition? That&#39;s absurd. Equally absurd is the javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules.</p>

	<p>The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new age--an age that each year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both syntactic sugar and also fundamental structure--especially the importing and exporting of modules. Therefore, philosophical Honor behooves each of us to a higher complexity, and a new commitment to, the &quot;Separation of Concerns.&quot; We can allow ourselves a break, thankful for Progress, a progress by which we must <i>Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</i>, and Code-Create!</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s Innocence</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Facebook Scandals <sup>1</sup> of recent months have demoralized the leadership for a role of misinformation in the Tech Age, however I charge Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s innocence <i>not</i> because all of us, as a society, were equally warned. Rather, arbitrary mathematical forces created abnormal, never-before-seen network structural density and symmetry patterns. Technological shifts were so efficient at multiplying and exacerbating misinformation because a curious sociological network phenomenon rendered parts of our daily social learning and acculturating process to network forces out of our own control.</p>

	<p>A January 2016 American Sociology Association Newsletter Editorial <sup> 2</sup> from Sally T. Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation were not entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social structural changes from higher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose links (in their content and influence) begin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words, the sway of trends and opinionated critical thought becomes dominated by the relationships, e.g., the &quot;likes&quot; and &quot;shares&quot;, leading to a statistically natural propensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a. group-think. The mechanism is akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel to the coastline, and (due to random coastal floor structure), a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal and tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary <i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p>

	<p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual &quot;interruptions&quot; that previously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains:</p>

	<p class="quote">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication that the timespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation Bias, misinformation and outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs that are already hard to change.</p>

	<p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned, <i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network phenomonenon--ultimately driven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density, symmetry, conditional influences, and the strength of ties outweighing network nodes. For the reasons of these factors, our social inclinations were <i>out of our control</i> -- no, but really, this time they were!</p>

	<p>And so, we can learn from Sociology what steps to take in order to counteract random, but risky, network phenomena -- because nobody likes to go for a swim at the beach, and unwittingly get shipped out to sea!</p>

	On the 2015 Social Sciences Modification to the AAMC Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT)</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Other than college pre-med students, few know the MCAT exam--the gatekeeper of U.S. &amp; Canadian Medical Schools--underwent a major modification in 2015. <sup>2</sup> Much deeper than Biological and Technological updates, major sections were added and/or expanded including the Social, Pyschological and Biological foundations of <i>behavior</i>.

Dr. Jeffrey Borkan, MD, PHD of Brown University&#39;s Warren Alpert Medical School, explains the evident role of all those unnoticed social interactions involved in obtaining and consuming that apple. Further, the spatial and economic <i>availability</i> of that apple also plays a role in keeping the doctor away. Borkan explains:</p>

	<p>What, then, specifically, are the mechanisms that a community network&#39;s aggregated health may be inextricably tied up with <i>our own</i> individual health? In short, they are the sharing of health-promoting resources, timely assistance, health-promoting information channels -- all this, among the countless perks of a healthy social circle!</p>

The past 50 years&#39; social changes and new problems are generally atrributed for the increasing demand for sociological expertise after 1999, after a singular, senseless tragedy of a school shooting--this event, like a small kernel of societal desperation for a solution--led to a flurry of self-professed sociologists &agrave; la Michael Moore&#39;s Colombine, and other social-responsibility themed social consciousness. So far, only mutually incompatible solutions. The problem, however, is not new, only the manifestation of it.</p>

	<p>Suicide rates in 19th century France, disproportionately high, also served as a symptomatic manifestation of the same problem, called <i>Anomie.</i> <sup>1</sup> The term, <i>Anomie</i>, coined by Emile Durkheim in the late 1800&#39;s, captured the sense of instability, cultural and moral relativism that undermined a shared sense of meaning. Suicides, week-after-week, month-after-month? In 1897 France, noone had ever seen it before--at such rates--and people wanted answers. Alas, a kernel of social desperation leading to inquiry.</p>

	<p>People wanted to know why so many in the population responded negatively to the rapid changes, urbanization (Dreadful factory conditions &agrave; la <i>Taylorism&#39;s</i> calculated efficiency) new technologies, i.e. electricity, railroads, steam engines; these created an arbitrarily new world, very suddenly. Suddenly, like trying for the first time a roller-coaster, when all you&#39;ve ever known has been the carousel. So, we see technology&#39;s role for well or for ill, our job is to understand how to dial-in the tech specs necessary to keep society smiling on this roller coaster through another, yet not altogether new, technological thrill-ride.</p>

	<h6><small class="jargon">Tech blockchain jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity! I treat a broad overview of the existing trajectory of blockchain-related micro-economic advancements. I make a technical &amp; contextualizing <abbr title="this link just goes down 5 paragraphs to Feb. 17th"> <a href="#18-02-17"> three-part blog series in my Feb. 17-20 posts</a> on the micro-economic horizon of blockchain technologies.</abbr> </small></h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Has anyone else been underwhelmed by the lack of Bitcoin&#39;s daily <i>presence</i>, despite its everpresence at the dinner tables and caf&eacute;s across America. Sure, it&#39;s more of a &quot;metropolitan&quot; phenomenon; and sure, it&#39;s become an accepted global platform--along with myriad other crypto-currencies, but it&#39;s exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood by many. Cryptocurrencies are useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires due to the currency&#39;s rise to fame with last year&#39;s increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc., etc. But, so far its contributions, uses, fame are one-sidedly <i>macro-</i>economic. A recent CNET article <sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of <i>actual</i> use at the &quot;cash-registers&quot; of society.</p>

	<p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological <i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Rogers&#39; <i>Diffusion of Innovations</i> <sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger&#39;s bell curve ranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority. However, the blockchain articles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared to the genuine usefulness for the every-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic use.</p>

	<p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is <i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific information--whether financial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in order before I continue, since we can all relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the risk most notably concerning Target store credit card hacks a couple years ago.</p>

	<p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these 3 transactions, this person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves for each transaction: they prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC or bank)will make that $27, $200, or $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction, they open their <i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft; and if the store&#39;s databases are hacked, then tough-luck!</p>

	<p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than for each transaction, providing the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient! Nobody thinks to walk around with their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their wad of cash and peel out a bill. The credit card system, blessed as it is, did not previously have technology to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions have had to rely on the many layers of security, passwords, pins, mothers&#39; maiden names, etc. Then, based on the mathematics behind prime numbers, they hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright red target on it.</p>

	<p>Now, the crypto-contract provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person. And that, my friends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value in crypto-currency, instead the crypto- <i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this hero&#39;s name is the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability to provide pinpointed, <i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number, for the sake of renting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They don&#39;t need this. They need to know only and exclusively driving-record related details--not the entire governmental database of information about you!</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Tech on the Regret: Unintended, secondary effects of communication- and activity-based app-designs</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Given that our app-use is inextricably tied up with our own behavior, activity/communication-based app developers have in the past year accepted (mostly in word) a renewed responsibility. More like resposibility for a multi-faceted power of influence granted to an industry, suddenly, disproportionately great, and <i>semi-arbitrarily related</i> to the designer&#39;s intent (and control!). After all, if the Saintly Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s activity/communication-based app inadvertantly led to novel, and deeply consequential, effects, then anyone could.</p>

	<p>After all, who could guess <i>how</i> these app-design effects would affect the users, years later. Who do we think programmers are, sociologists? More specifically, who could know <i>which</i> mundane coding practices, arbitrary app-design--like sharing permissions/features? Sure, everyone deep down knew their company practices yield unfathomable power of influence over the daily habits of cell-users, a.k.a. everyone. The easy part is knowing; the hard part is learning how and why certain app-features lead to behavioral risks.</p>

	<p>There could be no better example than the Alcoholic faced with an intervention by a loving family longing for change. The alcoholic could be forgiven for past misdeeds, but without actual <i>Acknowledgement</i> of a crisis in direction, which necessitates professional help from social scientists. Therefore, the recent <i>acknowledgments</i> signify something deeper--they signify a humility that app-designers are not sociologists, generally speaking. So, that means hiring sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists for every N <small>th</small> app-coder and software engineer. History can&#39;t be rewritten, but it can be interpreted and learned from. The acknowledgment is itself a victory if it induces learning from the raw, social sciences, whose expertise <i>can</i> predict how or why certain &quot;life&quot;-features, practices, and policies often unfold with undue and unintended social consequences.</p>

	<p>Water under the bridge, but going forward, it is one thing to claim a &quot;renewed sense of remorse&quot;, another to acknowledge, learn and change. Like last November <sup>1</sup> when Facebook co-founder Sean Parker confessed certain designs like &quot;social-validation feedback loop&quot; and other app-design intentions, while ignoring potential secondary effects on society. So, the <i>Acknowledgment</i> is the big win here--not so much the remorse!</p>

	<br />
	Seven Nuts &amp; Bolts Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy<br />
	<small class="jargon">Tech jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity! Here, I provide a technical &amp; contextualizing addition to my <abbr title="this link just goes up 7 paragraphs to Feb. 15th"> <a href="#18-02-15"> February 15th blog post</a> </abbr> on the micro-economic horizon of blockchain technologies. </small></h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">7 Ethereum-based technological features offer us a new world -- a decentralized new world, not dependent on the centralized servers of Instagram, Comcast, T-Mobile, Amazon, etc. With that statement ends general consensus among blockchain experts, pundits, and authors. However, if the current logistical obstacles provide controversy and competing algorithms over sustainability, security, and scalability, then they reveal much more about the general pathway of social uses (and potential effects) than they hide. In my February 15th <a href="#18-02-15">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain aspects of the crypto-contract horizon.</p>

	<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>

	<p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and the <i>productivity</i> of our work as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals? First, a little background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum blockchain helps distinguish itself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech, like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based blockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers a syntax and programming features, e.g. &quot;looping&quot;, &quot;recursion&quot;, with the full power of a <i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable problem.</p>

	<p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles the accounting system of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side. In contradistinction, An Ethereum blockchain transaction would resemble a network of computers, <i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for Quickbooks to calculate into a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program. Much more useful!</p>

	<p>Therefore, Ethereum&#39;s Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The Ethereum blockchain is actually a &quot;Virtual Machine&quot;, like a a big networked &quot;home computer&quot;. The native language of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an <i>application binary interface</i>, ABI. So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my home computer, then directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman&#39;s terms, the manner that modern-day app, for example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming Interface) that allows one programming system to interact with another, such as Instragram offers a &quot;sharing API&quot; that connects to hardware contacts, thus facitilating communicating with third-party aplications, like sharing your instagram picture to your Facebook account, via your T-Mobile phone&#39;s contacts list. This API relationship broadly describes the modern world we live in, wherein a Chryser driving system exchanges API information with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system, which exchanges API information with your own contact list, and so on, and our lives are made easier.</p>

	<p>So, are we out of the woods? Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920 pre-relativity days; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities immediately arise. The reason being that digital math uses binary &quot;on/off&quot; calculations, while quantum math implicates a tertiary, <i>qubit</i> &quot;simultaneous states&quot;. Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain technology, both programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example, IOTA&#39;s blockchain design utilizes a <i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one&#39;s transaction is entered into with a private-key, and the blockchain moreso resembles a &quot;Tangle&quot; of a directed graph, which allows for computational &quot;states&quot;. IOTA recently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that exposed an apparent vulnerability. In truth, this was a case of user-error because users were <i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home computer could crack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite advanced enough now to cause damage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in two, or other quantum possibilities.</p>

	<p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. Social useablity, potential scope and of course unintended consequences have all finally begun to emerge, at least in form, with little difference between the 2nd generation blockchain or the 3rd generation Patrician directed graph blockchain. The underlying principle of the blockchain&#39;s micro-economic utiliity through crypto- <i>contracts</i> is the same, as opposed to plain crypto-currency. you know the usual bartering solutions for Supply &amp; Demand leading to Economics Game Theory, etc. This is where we must take our leave of the Hard Sciences of Mathematics, and enter the realm of Sociology, Psychology, Anthropology and Economics.</p>

	<br />
	Seven Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy<br />
	<small class="jargon">Tech jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity! The first 3 of 7 new possibilities thanks to the programmable blockchain.</small></h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">The guiding light through the centuries of scientific paradigms, in the Kuhnian sense <sup id="19-1">1</sup>, have derived from deductive ideas from above - whether priestly or royal decree. Then, the primacy of the <i>Scientific Method</i> from the Renaissance forward--punctuated first by Copernican Heliocentrism, then other Paradigm Shifts--has directed rational and ethical norms in each respective period, e.g. Enlightenment authors of 17th, 18th century. Fast forward to the modern period, wherein the current era&#39;s emerging paradigm holds Sharing as a collective-priority and responsibility, then an amazing philosophical moment. <i>Historical Materialism</i> <sup>2</sup> prescribes what is directly here a novel Paradigm Shift by which authority is not derived from governmental, financial sources, but rather the <i>shared</i>societal consensus about cryptographic, mathematical proofs as true authority. Further, the revolutionary shift also innately provides tools for implemention through decentralized, programmable data-sharing. Cryptography has in a sense become a <i>de jure</i> middle-person for identification and verification of property.</p>

	<p><strong>I. Protecting rights through immutable records</strong><br />
	Inalieable Rights can now be identified and verified by the cryptographic authority of a mathematical proof, rather than exclusively through governmental or financial institutions from above. The modern period also has held this decentralized, individual authority as the <i>a priori</i> starting points for philosophical proofs. Premises about truth begin with the conditions of humankind, not idealogies. In fact, it was the <i>Young Hegelians</i> of early 19th century Vienna &amp; Berlin, who ushered in the Modern Era of Western Philosophy, by laying out Truth as inverted, beginning from the empirical &quot;ground&quot; upward. This &quot;upside-down tree&quot; defines philosophical modernity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the whole of <i>Existentialism</i> and 20th century philsophy is a mere subset, and never escapes Continental Materialism, as argued in Sartre&#39;s <i>Search for a Method</i>. <sup>3</sup></p>

	<p>All of the Sciences, prodded by this Truth of Empiricism, followed suit through all the tech innovations since Hegel. I&#39;m so surprised by this, because for me, the role of cryptography is shocking on two levels. First, cryptography resemblees philosophy rather than the Empiricism that I had envisioned would govern social rule (Some once thought nuclear sciences held this role--no longer! Mathematics takes the crown. Secondly, I&#39;m still dumbfounded that a Paradigm Shift <i>first</i> offers the tools to fulfill itself? Staggering to consider the arbitrary changes ahead for a society that is provided the tools of social structural change first, but how quite convenient!</p>

	<p><strong>II. Bureaucratic Atomization in a True Sharing Economy</strong></p>

	<p>It is satisfyingly reassuring to see the good-natured, altruistic efforts among the thousands, upon thousands of open-source volunteers, and blockchain innovators, like Vitalik Buterin author of Ethereum Virtual Machine, whose aims and efforts make staggering progress each quarter. The potential for removing the &quot;middle-person&quot; from the day-to-day, micro-economic &quot;cost of living&quot;. This goes for for the exchanging of titles, legal documents, etc.</p>

	<p>Sharing of Resources is, in my personal opinion, critical to global future--both out of increasing necessity in allocating increasingly limited resources; an arbitrary rearrangement of <i>Social Structure</i> and distribution of its resources. While the exponential population growth looms on the near horizon, a clear, pre-existing solution begins with a focus on <i>smart</i>, effective sharing of resources. The driving principle of sustainability is made convenient by means of blockchain technology, extending for example to local economies, cooperatives, ride-sharing, etc.</p>

	<p><strong>III. Removing Double-Dipping from International Remittances </strong></p>

	<p><i>&quot;Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.&quot; </i><br />
	--Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, 1939</p>

	<p>Taxes and tariffs are difficult enough, the double-dipping of the current international remittance system, &aacute; la Western Union, does not reflect the global, sharing Economy of 2018. The existing remittance system (not speaking to <i>centralized</i>, middle-man alternatives like PayPay, etc.)--supposing if I wire $2 Loonie to a Canadian friend&#39;s Canadian Bank--requires payments executed through two separate bank transactions in two national payments systems, thus the sending country and receiving country each take a cut. Like everything else--c&#39;est la vie. Or is it? The beauty of Ethereum is that it &quot;talks&quot; well with others and across borders, while Bitcoin remains of little use for micro-transactions that involve semi-basic calculations. The reason being that Bitcoin blockchain language, Script, cannot support loops (while statements, etc.)</p>

	<p>Currently, both EOS and Ethereum blockchains appear poised for the most financial-friendly blockchain tech.</p>

	<br />
	Seven Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy<br />
	<small class="jargon">Tech jargon alert ahead, with all effort made for clarity! The 4th through 7th outlined Features of the New Blockchain Micro-Economy</small></h6>
	&nbsp;

	<p class="firstparagraph">I feel that data is one of the more underestimated new commodities of the age. Most visualize data as rows and columns, and at most only non-conditional dynamic data. Data are not so mute! Data, in most object-oriented languages at least, represents <i>functions</i>, conditions, and predicted values. And so, our own behavior, coupled with our networks&#39; behavior, coupled with predictive analytics--this represents a wealth of information beyond our attributed or inherited traits. The programming is <i>in</i> the data, however, citizens have become less and less involved, ceding app by centralized app our own information and ensuring profit to 3rd party marketers. The centralized nature of the internet allows for this, while the new landscape of <i>decentralized applications</i> (DAPP) completely upends this structure of the status quo.</p>

	<p><strong>IV. Enabling citizens to own &amp; monetize their data (&amp; protect privacy)</strong><br />
	Ethereum offers a decentralized solution to &quot;owning&quot; one&#39;s own data, as data can be decentralized and returned to the individual&#39;s control, and <i>profit</i>. As sure as the 19th century&#39;s &quot;labor-hour&quot; became commodified to a calculable asset, i.e. property, which <i>another</i> party controls and makes profit; And as sure as the 20th century&#39;s data analytics became commodified into calculable assets for another party to take control and make profit; then only now in this 21st century does technology offer a new, more egalitarian path.</p>

	<p><strong>V. Ensuring compensation for the Creators of Value </strong><br />
	So, how would decentralized innovations of blockchain <i>distributed ledger</i> technology compensate those whose actions, behavior, opinions, friend-networks, artwork, music, videos and other contributions profit the creator?</p>

	<p><strong>VI. The Halcyon Age of Transaction-Chain Enterprise</strong></p>

	<p class="quote">According to Greek Mythology, the days of eery, noticeable lack of storms have never been interpreted as a period of grace. Moreso, <i>Halcyon</i> tranquility only means a temporary moratorium on the winds and waves, imposed by Aeolus, God of Wind, to protect the nesting eggs of Alcyone, his daughter.</p>

	<p>If blockchain tech changes how we do research, analysis, and forecasting, as much as it changes international, and cross-industry transactions, then are we faced with a similar dilemma as the &quot;novelty&quot;, and double-dealing, of multi-nationals of the 1990s? No, because blockchain renders organizations, even those with a spotty past, into transparent, democratic, efficient, secure and easily scrutinized.</p>

	<p>After all, without transparent proof, how else would I know my bananas are the &quot;pura vida&quot; Costa Rique&ntilde; ones? More importantly, what was the carbon footprint of that banana&#39;s journey from its native soil to my breakfast table? New blockchain companies like <a href="https://www.provenance.org/">Provenance.org</a>, <a href="http://www.skuchain.com/" target="_blank">skuchain</a>, <a href="http://www.blockverify.io/">http://www.blockverify.io/</a> are a few noticeable game-changers. So, for bananas not backed by mathematical proofs, I really have to ask myself, is it <i>really</i> an authentic Fair Trade banana?</p>

	<p>Transactions are hardly valuable in the products themselves, if removed from the value of the <i>transaction per se</i>. International supply chain transactions, by virtue of a recently possible decentralized, permanent record and monitoring, have begun to make inroads in agriculture, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, food-supply and other multi-stage industries.</p>

	<p>If corporate and governmental transactions are to be made public--many bearing enterprise or State secrets, then will forecasting also go the way of birds? Possibly. Online platforms like Augur <sup id="20-8">8</sup>are creating global, decentralized prediction markets, in domains like sports betting, financial markets speculation and so forth. Armed with vast, transparent knowledge, the everyday person can now access the whims and power of Aeolus, and forecasting the winds of Fortune.</p>

	<p><strong>VII. Reinventing Government &amp; Democracy</strong><br />
	...to be completed...</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber">Feb 21, 2018</h6>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Facebook-Friendly Third-Generation Data Structures</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Today, I&#39;m going to write about data structures, and challenges that face Vitalik Buterin and other blockchain architects. &#39; Now, why in the <i>world</i> would I or anyone else care about ooh, merge sorts, bubble sorts, classificatory trees, and the advent of a third form of data structure?</p>

	<p>Today, we live in an ever more relational world. With all our technology, we just can&#39;t wait to hear the latest gossip about sister Becky&#39;s Boyfriend&#39;s Brother&#39;s Friend that <i>also</i> got to meet Shakira. Gossip to one person is a valuable asset to the data analyst. Because, how else could an algorithm draw simultaneous conclusions about two friends that &quot;liked&quot; the same Samsung VR, and that they are both located near Best Buy. Thanks to classificatorial wisdom of AI &amp; plain machine-learning?</p>

	<p>These relational queries are simply too difficult for relational, row &amp; column SQL data structures. In fact, many queries are impossible, due to unprescient database schema architectures. Next, with the need to &quot;objectify&quot; data into non-relational objects, rather than an antiquated, rigid row-and-column design. Thus, the second major type of data structure is more flexible and adept in finding these relational queries that are ever more in vogue. However, the crystal-like, pristine non-relational, No-SQL designs quickly turn to spaghetti, and are poor for scalability. Between a rock and a hard place, a third data structure has emerged in recent years.</p>

	<p>Graph Data Structures <sup>2</sup> allow data queries that had otherwise been impossible to capture in an entity relationship diagram. The ideal example to clarify is the manner that the Swiss banks&#39; accounts were discovered to be hiding vast amounts of hidden taxes, etc. The cover-up was so well-constructed that not until new, graph database queries discovered patterns of money flow <sup>1</sup>:</p>

	<p class="quote">The data was then turned into a graph format to detect then fine-tune the connections between the nodes. The Swiss Leak held around 60,000 files that contained information about over 100,000 clients in 203 countries, which means that the resulting graph database had more than 275,000 nodes with 400,000 relationships among them.</p>

	<p class="quote">By being able to easily visualise the networks around clients and accounts, the reporters found many more connections than they had before, which lead to the Swiss Leaks revelations soon being shared with the public and regulators across the globe.</p>

	<p>And you thought that plagiarism-detecting software was impressive for complexity! The beauty of this newly available software (even Microsoft jumped on board in recent years) means that sociologists, economists can begin to make better headway in the way that our many interactions become more complex with more data. Remember, in the past ten minutes, more data information was just produced than most of human history! Thus, new and upcoming needs in domains like content management &amp; access control, geo-routing (public transportation), gene sequencing, bio-informatics, and so on. So, as technology takes us forward, and we make our considerations, let&#39;s stick by the golden rules of parallel processing, scalability, and, now, graph-network mindedness for the new data structures, and schema, of the Era!</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Languages</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">While I&#39;ve had blockchain-related topics on the mind lately, it seems I can&#39;t escape it as I broach new fields--blockchain is everywhere! Well, I had begun my blog with intentions about the accelerated speed of language and syntax formation, and the curious phenomenon I&#39;d call, for lack of a better word or or my own reading, &quot;declarative-syntax-merging&quot;. This involves the curious, and largely unknown, growth of JavaScript scripting language into almost every domain of web apps, data analysis, and even the bounds of <i>Logic</i> itself. Though I won&#39;t submit my readers to a history of a language, suffice it to say that, &quot;If a certain algorithm, device, or object is programmable, then it will eventually be programmed in JavaScript.&quot;</p>

	<p>Without getting into technicals, I&#39;ll instead use a perfect metaphor--the manner by which English merged with French, beginning with the conquests of William of Normandy, around 1096 onward. Almost a thousand years later, we can see how English grammar inherited it&#39;s Anglo-Saxon Linguistic roots, along with the core vocabulary; Then, as English vocabulary moves past the first few thousand core words, e.g. &quot;milk&quot; or &quot;house&quot; from &quot;melche&quot; or &quot;haus&quot;, then more than 70% of English Vocabulary is directly inherited from French, e.g. &quot;lactose&quot; or &quot;mansion&quot; from &quot;lait&quot; or &quot;maison&quot;.</p>

	<p>Similarly, the language of the web and original browsers, JavaScript, has similarly morphed into a new language called Solidity, but in only a micro-fraction of English&#39;s time. The usual FOMO logic propels coding language use, for example FOMO induced Microsoft&#39;s flagship Text Editor, Visual Code, to adopt it years ago. <sup id="22-1">1</sup> The language of Ethereum Blockchain is Solidity, which like the above example, has two parents, one non-legitimate. It is in all respects totally JavaScript, yet with object-oriented elements of C++. For the layperson, let&#39;s just say Solidity resembles a &quot;Liger&quot;, in it is at it&#39;s core JavaScript, yet with increasing sophistication based on C++ logic, its head and torso has begun to resemble the powerful machine-code of C++ ever more. And it is a beautiful, but curious phenomonenon.</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">1.4 Million Reasons for more Women in Tech</h6>
	<a href="#18-03-08" rel="stylesheet">Blog addressed again March 8, 2018 </a>

	<p class="firstparagraph">1.4 million <i>new</i> jobs by 2020; End over end, year after year, the computer programming industry continues to add another 20% more jobs each year, for the next five years. This is the only field that demand outstrips the supply--and increasingly short supply. So much so, the US Department of Labor forecasts U.S. citizens will be able to fill 39% of those positions; there are not enough Immigration visas (especially in the Trumpian era of isolationism) to make up the rest.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>So, how is it that only 14% of females in the entire field of cybersecurity? Silicon Valley is, at its best, obscenely one-sided. At Google, only 17% of the company&#39;s tech jobs are filled by women. Facebook women staff only 15% of tech jobs, and Twitter? 10% female. The figures on women in computer science across the nation, across the entire industry are not improving, but <i>declining</i>? <sup>1</sup></p>

	<p>Of course, we&#39;ve heard these statistics from any given headline, and in the halls across the university landscape, starting with Women in STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Mathematics) programs. <sup>3</sup> Yet, why, with so much money, so many programs, so many non-governmental, non-profit effort?</p>

	<p>I argue that tech <i>climate </i> is directly to blame. Who then? Not a person, but principles are to blame. Culture--often defined as shared beliefs, norms, language and behaviors--can hardly be changed, but it can be understood.<br />
	There is a book, called &quot;Program or be Programmed <sup id="24-4">4</sup></p>
	, by which the author explains social consequences of a dichotomized society--between those that manipulate the environment around them, whether automating tasks at work, or simply fixing a simple software bug, by adding a comma. This literacy of the Current Era is akin to the 26-letter alphabet of written sentences and paragraphs, and--not to be taken for granted--is the exclusive form of communication, outside of a 100-foot perimeter, up until 150 years ago. Knowledge is not power, the communication of knowledge is power.

	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<p>I argue that today, the power is to program one application programming interface (API) to talk to another API. In other words, the ability to directly communicate with software at the command-line is not now a requisite skill, but promotions would not escape this necessity! So, now reverting back to the subject of women in tech, American leadership is in deep peril without more female insight. I will finish by citing that Ares, the violent, untamed Greek <i>god of war</i>, cannot always drive the Capitalist engine; because She, Athena, the <i>goddess of intelligence</i> represents true strategy!</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Joys of Automation</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">While coding up a better shell for this website, I thought it&#39;s remarkable how our lives get easier and easier with each passing year of tech. Using JavaScript--the primordial web-coding language--I marvel at the convenience of delegating mundande coding stuff to taskrunners, like <i>Gulp</i>--a programmable package manager that &quot;bundles&quot; up the libraries to be used in the app. It is truly a joy!</p>

	<p>I write four styling <i>functions</i>, with about 16 <i>variables</i> and voil&agrave;! I finish in 3 hours what would have taken me 15 hours, then another 5 hours a month for upkeep. Instead, now, it&#39;s as though I wind up the clock, and need only periodically check, and perhaps update a variable or two ... Technology. I&#39;m gushing for joy.</p>

	<p>This was mere JavaScript--with a truly <i>Turing Complete</i>--pan-algorithm status--languages, the possibilities are 100-fold with Python language library collection; this library collection includes NASA modules, mathematical proofs, and limitless uses from web-scraping for unstructured data to an excellent data visualization collection. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m in the Library of Congress, and better yet because, PIP, the Python package manager acts and automates like a cyborg librarian, for lack of better imagery.</p>

	<p>I just have so much joy watching a project come to life, and it&#39;s even a greater delight if this project comes to life and stays alive, through the joys of automation!</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Cryptocurrency&#39;s Cumbersome Carbon Footprint</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">I must confess that on the very day that Our Daily Tech Blog gets an under-the-head make-over for security&#39;s sake, I wrote the new formatting file right over today&#39;s post. Amazing, and the two occurred nearly simultaneously as I worked on them, their paths crossed and poof, gone! Same platform, and I paid the price! Whether I change my ways is yet to be seen, but I shall continue with my original theme for the day, namely, Sustainability, a.k.a. Carbon Footprint.</p>

	<p class="quote">Power consumption is one of the major costs of bitcoin mining, as dedicated machines crunch the algorithms that build a record of every single bitcoin transaction and are rewarded with tiny fractions of a bitcoin for their efforts. <sup id="explain">1</sup></p>

	<p>Today I have a mild Critique and Praise for the blockchain sustainability problem caused by sky-high electricity bills! Computer algorithms do waste electricity, not like your Widescreen. More electricity is gobbled up by small and large mining operations in nearly every country than small nations! <sup id="electricity">1</sup>. Ethereum, Bitcoin and a handful of other &quot;Proof-of-Work&quot; designs require electricity because the investment in equipment itself is investment, but more importantly, two-way incentivation for mining drives the system, and the scarcity demand through difficulty computations.</p>

	<p>So, is the electricity consumption really <i>correlated</i> with the value, scarcity, of the currency? Yes. Digiconomist--a cryptocurrency analysis site <sup id="digiconomist">3</sup> estimates <i>each</i>Ethereum transaction represents a 45 Kilowatt-hour of electricity&#39;s mining. (A visa credit card transaction is 0.00651 kWh. The entire Ethereum global blockchain could be &quot;using as much as 4.2 Terawatt-hours (tWh), or slightly more than the country of Cyprus <sup id="cyprus">1</sup>.&quot; So, electricity comparisons are telling, but how does this relate to its environment impact, sustainability itself?</p>

	<p>Carbon Footprint, our energy consumption index, can be compared to another element of scarcity, which dictates fluctuations in value: Gold. According to <i>Digiconomist</i>, an average household&#39;s Carbon Footprint is about 10 tons of CO2 per year. The article does the math for us very succinctly:</p>

	<p class="quote">On top of this, we can find that the process of mining Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t just more energy-intensive, but also has a bigger environmental impact. To reach that conclusion, we first need to estimate the carbon footprint for both. For Bitcoin we can, again, get this number from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index. For gold, we assume a carbon footprint of 20 tons of CO2e per every kilogram of gold mined <sup id="digiconomist2">3</sup>.</p>

	<p>The article continues to clarify that 33,000 kilograms of CO2 per unit mines (comparatively, one Bitcoin&#39;s worth of Gold is 4,000 kilograms of CO2). At the end of the day, the electricity costs--if not sustainable long-term--could spell trouble. Hence, the three S&#39;s, mentioned last, sustainability is perhaps a larger issue than blockchain Security and Scalability challenges. Again, this is a problem that the third largest cryptocurrency does not have: <i>Ripple</i>, which does not bear a carbon footprint <sup id="ripple">4</sup>.</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">After Yesterday&#39;s Scathing Post, A Look at my own Carbon Footprint</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">In my reflections about environment sustainability issues, I confess I&#39;m sort of a hypocrite ... The whole matter that caused my own introspection begins with my usual daily vexation: Tangles of wires!<br />
	&nbsp; ... I&#39;ve been having electricity issues, here as of late ...</p>

	<p>On one side, my tiny Yoga Ultrabook usually likes to charge just fine with my phone charger--if I&#39;m stuck without my charger. And due to an untimely end to the charger, I needed a replacement. So, singular errand of the day was a trip to Best Buy to peruse for a 45-Watt USB-C charger ( the new oval charging port on Samsung 8&#39;s, LG G6&#39;s and newer Apple products).</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, my credit-card sized Raspberry Pi computer runs on an old-school USB charger--a whole Linux Server Tower on a cell-phone charger. Then, we have my trusty Dell (actual) Tower with 16 Gigs of RAM, 2-terabytes, etc. that also seems to need an extra fan to stay cool--probably the sustainability of 100 Raspberry computers. My entire carbon footprint changes more with the electrical products that I use, than my vehicle! Well, I also confess my Jeep Cherokee can&#39;t even boast 20 miles per hour ... oops, conscience pangs, ouch ... Well, hypocritical, slightly, but found not guilty since I&#39;m a bike-commuter for life!</p>

	<h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">One Last Word about Bitcoin&#39;s Carbon Footprint</h6>

	<p class="firstparagraph">Environmental Sustainability, again, and a higher-level view of the dilemmea...I couldn&#39;t resist:<br />
	Bitcoin&#39;s Initial Coin Offering was 2011 or so, then Ethereum, with Ether for currency was 2015; These two, ever so prescient designs, also have their Achilles Heal. These two are <strong>&quot;Proof of Work&quot; currency algorithsms</strong>. This means that the &quot;Demand&quot; side of supply-and-demand, derives from <i>difficulty levels</i> of crypto-blocks to mine. So, miners are incentivized to spend $1500 on a semi-mediocre-good mining rig (which is basically 20 NVIDIA Graphics Cards tied together to stack of two-by-fours with lots of fans ... erhem, sustainability?...</p>

	<p>And for each block that is &quot;solved&quot;, hence the block being validated, and somebody&#39;s cryptocurrency purchase/transaction is resolved! (takes about 12 minutes for the whole global blockchain to cycle, and Ethereum is less than a minute). So, the whole cycle continues, churning through coal- and carbon-stained hands of the electricity fed to these crypto-mining rigs <sup>1</sup>. For many it&#39;s a hobby, like the British Hobbyists&#39; love for ham- and short-wave radio setups, yet this profitable, yet particular hobby resembles the 1870&#39;s coal factory smoke stacks in South London!</p>

	<p>Let&#39;s face it, if Ethereum is able to successfully hard-fork to a Proof-of-Stake system soon--and Vitalik Buterin and his crew assure us it is coming <sup>2</sup>--then great--problem solved, everything eventually converts to Ethereum. If <i>not</i>they face an existential threat. Because, in a more enlightened ten years from now, those mining depots <i>would</i> look like unfettered factory smoke-stacks. Proof-of-Stack, whose currency value is not set to difficult of algorithm puzzle (hence, <i>proof-of-work</i>, but rather to ownership of &quot;voting pools&quot;, which is a <i> <strong>Consensus-Based Blockchain algorithm</strong> </i> [Complex subject best reserved for a rainy day, or better yet, no day! I may revisit this alternative in a funner way, here&#39;s a glimpse from Vitalk&#39;s @VitalikButerin tweet yesterday:</p>

	<p class="quote">Question for mathematicians: is there a assumed-to-be-normal number (ie. digits are random, like pi or e) where you can calculate the nth digit in log(n) (or even polylog(n)) time? If so, then H(x) = digits[x ... x+100] seems like it would be a cool cryptographic hash algo.</p>

	<p>Now, I am by no means a detective, but by the sound of those tweets, the Proof-of-Work algorithm seems to still be of utmost importance ...</p>
