<h3>Research Interests</h3>   
<div class="innerAcc"><p>My academic interests center on the methodology of education research in K-12 and higher education. Specifically, I research post-secondary education's potential in creating life opportunities, or in some cases potential pitfalls. For example, data on college graduation rates (sourced from the National Center for Education Statistics' datasets on public, two-year community colleges) indicate an 81% 2-year-to-4-year transfer aspiration level among during students' first year. Yet, only 21% transfer within six years; this latter figure continues to decline, especially among low-income and first-generation college students.  <br /> 
  <br />
In this age, many of the education problems cannot be solved without referring to historical precedent for guidance. For example, compare the social-cultural conditions of three case studies on national education reform--that is, 1807-1830's Prussian reforms on free public primary education, and the 1870-1880's French Jules Ferry reforms that inspired free secondary schooling. The third historical period--surrounding the U.S. Higher Education Act and Congressional Reauthorizations between 1964 and 1972--aims to understand a similar nationalized route toward affordable public education access, i.e., post-secondary schooling--a college education that is apt for a globally competitive, and diversified, labor market in last century's information-based Third Industrial Revolution. </p> <br />
<p>My social-historical ethos, theoretically informed by Pierre Bourdieu's commitment to qualitative and quantitative research methods; further, social science must adhere to the tenets of reproducibility, metric validity, and actionable, scientific resolution. I use R Code and Stata programming to advance the precision and exponential power of statistical analysis, without ignoring the human-element through qualitative case-study research. Lastly, a little about myself: My family and nearly all of my descendants are from central and northern New Mexico. I was born in Idaho, spent my early childhood in Paris, France, and enjoyed residence in Idaho, New York, Texas and Albuquerque, NM. </p>
