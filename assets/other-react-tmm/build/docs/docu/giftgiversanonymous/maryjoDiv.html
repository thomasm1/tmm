1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the div. The elements within this div have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math".

You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

  <p class="intropage">Mary Jo's Experience:  </p>
  <p class="new_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first  joined Gift Givers Anonymous and helped distribute gifts to unsuspecting  receivers I was a bit apprehensive about approaching strangers.  I thought, &ldquo;If anyone approached me in such a  way, I would probably take a step back or keep walking.&rdquo;  After watching Kalei approach people with a  big smile, kind and comforting words, I thought, &ldquo;I can do this.&rdquo;  So I did.   The more I handed gifts the more comfortable I became.  The more comfortable I became the more I  watched the people I approached relax. <br />
  Watching people&rsquo;s reactions when we handed  them a gift for no reason, other than to spread some gifts of Kindness was pure  JOY!  The excitement on the people&rsquo;s  faces at getting something gifted to them wrapped in colorful paper or a  festive bag, WOW!!  </p>
  <p class="new_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you were  to ask me which person affected me the most it would be the woman I saw ringing  the bell for the Salvation Army bucket donations outside a Wal-Mart.  She was the cheeriest bell ringer I had ever  seen!  She wore a hat with a light  blinking Christmas tree on it.  I was  drawn to her unabashed smile, warm cheery words of the season for everyone who  passed her by.  When I gave her a gift  she was so excited!  We hugged.  It dawned on me that I may have made an  impact on this person!  What a euphoric  feeling.  To think that this, simple act  of giving made one woman ecstatic is truly heart-warming and humbling. </p>
  <p class="new_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m  hooked!  I have to continue being  involved in this project in any way possible – giving, buying items to donate,  wrapping, organizing, distributing, or taking pictures of the givers &amp;  receivers.   Check out the pictures from  last year (2012) when we had three generations involved in wrapping and two  generations involved in giving.  What  great energy, teamwork and fun we all had.</p>
  <p class="new_blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think,  the 1st year we had 10 gifts to give, the 2nd year we had  20 gifts to give and December 2012 (year 5) we had over 100 gifts we gave  out.  That is amazing!  This year, the project has grown so  phenomenally that  storage space had to be rented to hold all the items and  gift wrapping that people have been so generous in donating, and it is busting  at the seams.  Just imagine all the  people that are going to be blessed and touched by the kindness of  strangers.  Will you be one of those  strangers who join us in making this a movement with ramifications that ripple  through Albuquerque and beyond?</p>
