-It is only Winslow's sense of humour to interrupt proceedings to spite other of the delegates. It was upon Winslow's and others unnamed nominations--as two are requirei 

iWinslow's presence on the conference under some guise or other his technical expertise. yet, according to the rules any unaccounted reservations--automaticalloy delay proceedings one-half hour. It's a long-time Street-cats' actful spite about the Confederacy.

Re: Re: Re: Re:Lost data & Wrongful arrest of Winslow at Pike Place Fish Market Smuggling-Bust
They say the algorithm serves for the rocket-head, and the data provide the rocket fuel. Therefore, my valued cat investors, whiskered friends, and feline colleagues that have gathered here tonight: I tell you this evening that no worthwhile failed attempts should be without the same grande spectactale as the successful liftoffs -- thus we can look with equanimity whether our rocket fuel is spilled in a static explosion of might and awe for the wider feline world to behold, even atop the launchpad. Or, and more preferably as intended--along a burning trail that traces to the skies above!  <br />
The facts are that some data was "spilled" over the weekend, and indeed the fireball was bright. Furthermore, the facts of Winslow's arrest, stolen scratchlet and stolen data reveal a different set of facts according to my view.  We should wait and rejoice for the billowing and blackening smoke, and the flames as they yet smolder even through this night.  In the name of progress we took our risk and in the name of progress we take our reward! <br />
I can assure you that Winslow's arrest, bond-hearing, and upcoming litigation will by no paw interfere with the next set of benchmarks, at least technically related. This W and I can guarantee.  In fact, as fortune and W's mystical foresight would have it, the competition, the market-regulators, they have in their possession a red-herring:  W's lost scratchlet carried the algorithms, as they were coded and pawed, and as they were since 11-11-15--these were the algs used in conjunction with the data involved with the recent calamity.  They reflect lost progress from months earlier, relating to an unused--and easily discarded--branch of progress.  Since that time--and unrelated to any propriety tinged by the recent smoke--TMM took W's algs, then we created five separate inter-dependent "t-solid rocket boosters" that provide new, dynamic data for every 1/5 of the real, rocket-fuel that is consumed upon the each ninth stage of "lift-off". Whether W's data and designs are implicated with the Pike Place Sting or not is simply a thing no cat or human will know, at least for now. The board does need to consider the upcoming dates of the MRCK's annual <<Dat-n-CoG>> Fashion Show, in which we cannot be found wanting. W will meet the one million euro bond well before this date. Nonetheless, the data spilt and the cat's out of the bag. Therefore, We, acting as governing board must act quickly--in spite of W's regretful absence--to vote for 100% Unveiling of the T-(9) Titanium, Turquoise, Cobalt and gold earring-bluetooth walkie-talkie--and we do have W's written assent and paw-print as I am now passing along. And so, I think there won't be any questions from media regarding W's current legal situation, or they'll be deflected given that my contact let me know he'll be free by the morning. However, questions will linger as to the reason for his whereabouts at Pike Place, and how arrested? I too, share your concern and yet technical plans must nonetheless go forward on the On-Time Five-SRB-Coordinator! <br />For Cat Eyes Only<br />
