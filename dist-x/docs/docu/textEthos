<p>My social-historical ethos, theoretically informed by Pierre Bourdieu's commitment to qualitative and quantitative research methods; further, social science must adhere to the tenets of reproducibility, metric validity, and actionable, scientific resolution. I use R Code and Stata programming to advance the precision and exponential power of statistical analysis, without ignoring the human-element through qualitative case-study research. Lastly, a little about myself: My family and nearly all of my descendants are from central and northern New Mexico. I was born in Idaho, spent my early childhood in Paris, France, and enjoyed residence in Idaho, New York, Texas and Albuquerque, NM. </p>
