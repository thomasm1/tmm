<br />I at first turned down two initial offers to participate as a translator on account the commitment and the danger. 
Set in a cushy weekly piece that kept my free time at bay, I hardly had thoughts of flying to Toronto for 4 nights. But my calling as a Citizen of the World called me North. Let us say that I felt comopelled because I learned the many dialects of Feline from an encounter in my youth. As a boy of perhaps a few years, our family house-sat at the English neighbors, the friends of my Papan. Of course, they had a cat that aroused the surest of curiosities like my own. Needless to say, in a brief moment of time after pulling the cat's tail--just in that very moment did we agree that he would spare but for one scar, a light, invisible "C" on my cheek. Only I knew and those I showed this light, yet lasting scar. The cat showed mercy to me in that moment and thus--in the briefest of milliseconds of time I agreed to act as Protector of all cats among all kingdoms and across the Species.  The years passed until the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, Two-Thousand sixteen. At the stroke of midnight, my scar disappeared from sight as clearly as the sun separates from the sky on the moonless, eclipsed night. That night I knew my calling was sent and so I made the appropriate arrangements to attend the conference, in the role and limited capacities as a UN-protected general bystander, apprentice-journalist, and part-time historiographer.  My knowledge of four languages proved vital for my attendance. I know two dialects of SCS (Southern Cat Syndicate), which is enough for other translators to fill in the gaps into other dialects.  I also know human javaScript, R, and XML. These shall serve the cats for the exponential growth of Cat <i>scratchlets</i>, and any collar-maget reading and communication devices.  Household Cat-scratchlet usage entirely bypassed the traditional personal cat padlet, with the <i>Yarn-ball and Yarn-pad</i> and immediately picked up with the Walkie-Talkies and Collar-phones. <br />
It is for these reasons, I surmise, that a new Cold War in Cat Fashion may be near to erupt. According to reports, one semi-truck was smuggled with Fancy-Feast Cans, and some say a small drone was operated. Therefore, the demand for more Human-Computer languages, cultures, and most of all fashionable accessories.
<br />According to most accounts, I collected through interviews, the human-computer-technology swaps from underground manufacturing firms in the north are replete with the finest and most expensive Cat products and even palatial homes--vacant of human owners, except on paper. I found there are underground knitting and yarn cooperatives that span miles in all directions--at the depth of at times 1,500 feet. Two Cat-Friendly sky-scrapers were recently purchased by anonymous donors, under obvious pseudonyms as "Mr Smith the Brother of Miss Jen's sister's half-nephew-in-law"--clearly the syntax of Cats!  It was clearly a curiosity of wealth for the cats and I was very happy for these friendly, rambunctious animals of the Highest Order. And so this recent curiosity placed the the truth in my possession, and so with respect for all Human Friends of Cats across the species, these details have not been spared.  And yet, I must confess my account of this narrative in English is due in fact that my business partner and Co-Proprietor of TMSquare.net, Mr. Winslow from Chicago, only reads English. Be it known that our agreement of my 50.9% and Winslow's 49.1% means two different percentages. Although in truth Human math rounds up by the decimal point to my 51% ownership, the mathemecat axia define that in binary situations, i.e. logistic regressions, such as the TCat-Winslow divide, my 50.9% rounds down to 50% and thus in all cat kingdoms, Winslow is recognized as Fully One-Half Owner as clear as 50%/50%.  I happen to know that mathematica only uses integers, but I certainly don't want to insult my business partner. After all, it seems to be Winslow that holds all the cards each time I read the news. For Cat Eyes Only.

Blog on the Greater Cat Kingdoms
Papparrazi-shots devalue with the dissemination of selfies thus making the 
the private life easy, and therefore a photo on the Night in Toronto
calling rumours over a recent Cat-Human Tri-Partite Continental Conference. 
Most obviously, for the exchange of cat freedoms, protections, and more public
cat funding for peace, and also Feline technology-sharing agreements.  These rumours are most assuredly true. The parties
involved included the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate--which introduces the
second economy (80% of underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and
BC) currently under the direction of the crime boss "Don Leonzo" (grey
Tabby, 8 years)--with the Middle-Region Canadian Cats (MRCC), and by
conference call, NACK (Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom--a kingdom
holding more underground wealth in little Halifax, Canada than 
Los Angeles and Chicago combined). I acted as Cat-Human translator
under the contractual agreement with the MRCC, NACK, and the SCS.
All parties agreed on the CN Tower, 10:30 p.m., Table A1, in Toronto
as the most neutral location. No jumping out of the agreement at
the last minute--even for the bravest of cats. The unnamed Human 
Lobbyists and Representatives from various nations, though mostly 
francophone nations, France, Canada, Quebec, Great Britain, 
Germany, Russia and Israel, among other nations. One representative 
from Kellog (only private Lobbyist). I come before you in full
disclosure and with open agreements of both the humans and cats,
that in exchange for my translating services, I accept, as
co-proprietor and representative of TMM (pronounced TMSquare),
the unanimous nomination and sponsorship by the Certification
and Knighting as Official Member of the Distinguished KCBB 
club. (Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling club--one of only eight other
living humans.) Therefore, I assure you, fellow stock-holders 
that the future of TMSquare is bright. The second pronouncement is that the secret TMM co-proprietor's identity is none other than Winslow, the brother of Cyrus, now living in Seattle, Washington. Thomas Milton owns 50.9% and Winslow 49.1%. I ensure the Board that Cat-Human company ownship is now recognized by 38 mostly first-world countries.

<br /><br />
How does one measure a Cat's inspiration to go outside and excercise? And, how does one evaluate the big-boned Tigers and Lions' depth or fragility of modeling effort? Here at TMSquare Cat Fashion and Technology Evaluators, our professional research efforts center on the methodology of Cat-Human Metrics and Sharing of Technology toward the Greater Cat-Cause: As always, the Halifax SPCA shall co-facilitate the 10% Pre- or Post-Tax Automatic Donation to Continental SPCAs and Cat-Parks (Including Sphere-Racing and Tower-Climbing-Races (2014 marked the first race up the Dubai Towers, whose entire height served 9 cat racers, outfitted with velco-claws and the ten-lane Wall-Strip).  We at TMM also recognize there are no places of work or business, except in certain regions, and so each of our franchised locations cater to culturally-competent cat needs, likes, and most of all, delicacies of the wider Cat Kingdoms that are demanded of our services.
TMM's passion for serving the Cats and Cat-Households in the vastness of the NorthWestern Continent. </p>
