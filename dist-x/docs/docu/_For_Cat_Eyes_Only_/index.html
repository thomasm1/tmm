Fiction
<br />For Cat Eyes Only<br />
<br />Blog<br />
<br />Fiction blog, April <br />For Cat Eyes Only <br />
<br />On Young Cy<br />Contrary to most understanding, the Middle Region Canadian
Cats (MRCC) hail from their territorial provenances in the West.  <br />According to the revered
geographer and cultural mystic, i.e., Cyrus the brother of Winslow (brother by pedigree and caretakers, 
yet brothers hetero-litter--(As Winslow once coined it)--the same from brother Cyrus,
Alliegiance intrinsic to the praiseworthy Feline Species, as custom would have it, derives 
from  --1.(Very often at the address of the human caretakers), and of course, "CW", or as 
some refer of the Higher Power of all Cats, The "Collective Whim". <br />Cyrus, in the musings of his street 
days, first pawed the now fashionable custom of the cats: At the sight of food, look up and pay mind 
to Cat King, Cat Kin, and Cat Kind! Cyrus' other <i>cat fad</i> from many seasons ago, was his battle cry first learned upon
the near-capture by a traveling band of ill-minded motorized humans--with the shrill that shattered each 
tempered pane among the motorized caravan--Winslow shrieked, Give me my Whim or Give me my next life! What a sight
it was, I'm told. The ill-intentioning caravaners tried to capture Cyrus, Cy 
vanished before the last pain fell to the iced highway.  Yet Cy's greatest yet contribution was a careful outlining
of the MRCC and their regions.<br /> There are two reasons as outlined by the charter--first known as the 
<i>Continental Cat Understanding</i>, that along with what is now the Northern Alliance, 
they should to fight for better trade--whether for the livery trading of fish, 
new yarn, and other staples unavailable in the hinterland. 
These, according to Cy, separated from the Southern Cat Syndicate around the time when the 
notorious Don Leonzo was a mere yeungling kitten, yet oblivious to the massive fortuned 
empire amassed by the lineage of his mother care-taker, Leona. <br />
Very little is known of this rich lore. Leonzo, once grown to strong kitten, continued in the same vein of 
<i>territorializing</i>--as the cat's call it--over the course of eight seasons, through 
networks.<br />Troubling as it appeared, this began to irreversably sidetrack the peace of the cat trade--fancy
feast cans quintrupled in cost--forget the new yarn!! The street and domestic dealings of fish narrowed and great
apprehension grew in the land. This of course fractured much trade into the second cat economy,
leading to many misunderstandings. The Jaguars of the north became convinced of this solution--
what was then named the Coastal Underground Economy. Thus, the riches from the Halibut, 
as much as from the common yarnlet trickets, grew even more sparse. 
<i>Topsy-Turvy Inteet!!!</i> as Cy would love to meow. 
Hunger, as any cat would reason, devalues any economy. Thus, for a long period of seven times the four seasons,
there were so few affordable delicacies for those not willing to parlay.  Fancy Feast deprivation, from the cold, grey sky over the November beaches of the West to the parched, heated piercing sky over the jungles of the East.  One may say, they were dire days--or, so it is according to my source--for I, as human, can only repeat what is reported to me, which is my Oath of Herodotus, per my Historiographical Contract to recount the daily lives that most fashionably shapes cat lives across all kingdoms. <br /> For Cat Eyes Only <br />

<br />March <br />
<br />Prologue, Chapter II<br />
Return of Winslow:<br /> <br />For Cat Eyes Only<br />It makes now,
let's see, seven months since we had last heard from engineering. 
The surprise did  not disappoint anyone -- as it happens, the lofty idea of 
assigning five separate algorithms, with each of the five parts of the data analysis, 
implies that each can also be equally distributed via
the memory consumption. Both of the good news: Two thumbs up. So, 
what we do is to program five separate tasks for every large "dump" of unstructured
 public or non-public data.
Thus, for every four-processor pc out in the world: Taking the caspering cat to task, let's
ask: Does it make more sense to assign four-hundred pounds to the 
one cat, and fifty pounds-each to the rest of the
five standing around? Or, does it better yet make more
sense to specifically request that each of four, eight, or sixteen processors, that they distribute tasks likewise? If so, then: Off your seat, bat your paws, and off to lunch!

Why Wait, Winslow? Right? Bat at your scratchlet and, Write! ...seered the Oracle of Halifax to W upon his arrival to the 9-week retreat. Near the time period that W's attorneys began discovery proceedings, W decided
upon the north for direction. Since the age of the passage of the Lacey Act, the Western seas' wildlife protection statutes have only emboldened
the international traffickers, while all cats have suffered needlessly at the hands of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--the Death Star of the seas for what concerns all continental cats. Certain fish of the most peculiar and extraordinary of tastes--suddenly and de jure outlawed--spawned a new black market entirely devoted to fish. Months passed, and a return to normalcy
meant one thing only: The long, crushing suffering of Winslow's unwilling abstinence should come to an end.  W's love affair with Yellowtail amberjack Seriola lalandi would be restored. Tasty treats like these must never be heated above 1&deg; celsius (or in cat knowledge, 90 seconds out of ice--which is
a rare fish whose purity of taste should trump play-time) Winslow is a cat of extreme tastes, and each night he lit a candle for the separation--or at least, so I was told by W his self. The finest catch, so rare, so delicate, it was said that one tongue-lash, and 
any cat could be enamoured, so that the expanse of the seas should be searched without avail for an equally sublime flavor. According to Winslow, all market machinations returned to normalcy--under the table--and yet, all in the shadows of the alley for certain fish.  This was so until the onset of "Operation Crush"--an effort led by, again, USFW drawing the ire of all Western cats, especially 
those most hurt by the operation. My concern is that no-one mentioned of any change or new action on fish protectinos at the Tri-Partite Conference, involving cooperation of Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom, Middle-Region Canadian Cats, and the Southwestern Cat Syndicate. There are major problems that have my worst fears racing: If lawlessness breaks out again between regions, the digital fashion trade, the electronics and technology sharing,
legitimate trade--All at Risk!<br />For Cat Eyes Only<br /></p><br /><br />

Re: Re: Re: Re:Lost data & Wrongful arrest of Winslow at Pike Place Fish Market Smuggling-Bust
<br />They say the algorithm serves for the rocket-head, and the data provide the rocket fuel. Therefore, my valued cat investors, whiskered friends, and feline colleagues that have gathered here tonight: I tell you this evening that no worthwhile failed attempts should be without the same grande spectactale as the successful liftoffs -- thus we can look with equanimity whether our rocket fuel is spilled in a static explosion of might and awe for the wider feline world to behold, even atop the launchpad. Or, and more preferably as intended--along a burning trail that traces to the skies above!  <br />
The facts are that some data were "spilled" over the weekend, and indeed the fireball was bright. Furthermore, the facts of Winslow's arrest, stolen scratchlet and stolen data reveal a different set of facts according to my view.  We should wait and rejoice for the billowing and blackening smoke, and the flames as they yet smolder even through this night.  In the name of progress we took our risk and in the name of progress we take our reward! <br />
I can assure you that Winslow's arrest, bond-hearing, and upcoming litigation will by no paw interfere with the next set of benchmarks, at least technically related. This W and I can guarantee.  In fact, as fortune and W's mystical foresight would have it, the competition, the market-regulators, they have in their possession a red-herring:  W's lost scratchlet carried the algorithms, as they were coded and pawed, and as they were  11-11-15--these were the algs used in conjunction with the data involved with the recent calamity.  They reflect lost progress from months earlier, relating to an unused--and easily discarded--branch of progress.  Since that time--and unrelated to any propriety tinged by the recent smoke--TMM took W's algs, then we created nine separate inter-dependent "t-solid rocket boosters" that provide new, dynamic data for everyninth of the energy-consuming(wasting), rocket-fuel data that is consumed upon the each ninth stage of "lift-off". Whether W's data and designs are implicated with the Pike Place Sting or not is simply a thing no cat or human will know, at least for now. The board does need to consider the upcoming dates of the MRCC's annual Dat-n-Cog &copy; Fashion Show, in which we cannot be found wanting. W will meet the one million euro bond well before this date. Nonetheless, the data spilt and the cat out of the bag, therefore, We, acting as governing board must act quickly--in spite of W's regretful absence--to vote for 100% Unveiling of the T-(9) Titanium, Turquoise, Cobalt and gold earring-bluetooth walkie-talkie--and we do have W's written assent and paw-print as I am now passing along. And so, I think there won't be any questions from media regarding W's current legal situation, or they'll be deflected given that my contact let me know he'll be free by the morning. However, questions will linger as to the reason for his whereabouts at Pike Place, and how arrested? I too, share your concern and yet technical plans must nonetheless go forward on the WM-Nine-SRB-Coordinator! <br />For Cat Eyes Only<br />

fIGHTS, FIGHTS, and more FIGHTS! It seems every single decision must be reconsidered, and nuanced, and then 
rejected all in a day's work with Winslow. Reading his msg this morning, wow: I haven't spoken to him in 5 months and not written with him in maybe
three days and in that span of time has transpired: a) New debates of the spelling of MeeooW Inc. or Meeoow Inc. because Winslow can't stand for his name to be lower case. He is incensed over the matter still. Winslow has no idea in the world how the English language works, but amazingly this cat has a way with irony and sarcasm and double entendres, so go figure.
More perplexing is Winslow's absolute disbelief in superstition--cats are by far the most superstitious civilization I have ever encountered. I'm no theologian, so I don't pry into these matters. Well, W's solution is to invert the name to "OoWMee", or back to "OwMe" or rather--"Owe-Me.net"? A bit scathing for a company name.  TMM has graciously provisioned us for a three-month runway for turning profit, and we don't even have a name yet! <br />By any other business plan, my situation would virtually prophecy failure. Yet, Winslow and I agree on a number of ideologies, and one big item is that we both reject bourgois business models that must immerse itself instantly into debt, first to early-investors, then banks, then promised riches to share-holders.<br /> We arrive there by inverting "stages", not the whole process, along the path toward maturity. Just like the sentence that is reversed, not by its structure but by the parts, the words. Hence, the structure achieves the same purpose, and yet the words are reversed, providing nuanced and better meaning. Thus mean-ing is ing-mean. "Preview" in the old sense is now "Viewpre" in the new meaning. Cat's are naturally ambi-directional, yet thankfully I read right to left thanks to Hebrew's direction.  MMMmhhhh. I still prefer a form of w Meow.net over Owme.net. <br />
Rather than being led by the cart of debt and promised profit, year after year, TMSquare grants us the freedom to put the cart after the cat, that we may forage forth along the path of what is good, what is beautiful, and what is useful (which by our non-bourgeois logic, translates into profit anyway). We never fear, but we do admire the cart of growing profit in our rear-view shoulder-holster mirrors, as somehow this enterprise gains momentum by the brawn of one cat and the logic of one man... so, again, Winslow, shall it be "Meow?" "Owme" (which still leaves Winslow uncapitalized, and worse yet is "Woem", which makes backward letters and cats are almost always very superstitious against this sort of reverse. Absolute taboo) or "meow" MeeoW, ..? Perhaps this may satisfy Winslow and his whimsical taste--a taste that may alter the digital-fashion lives of thousands of cats across the land.

I at first turned down two initial offers to participate as a translator on account the commitment and the danger. Set in a cushy weekly piece that kept my free time at bay, I hardly had thoughts of flying to Toronto for 4 nights.
But my calling as a Citizen of the World called me North. Let us say
that I felt compelled because I learned the many dialects of Feline
from an encounter in my youth. As a boy of perhaps a few years, our
family house-sat at the English neighbors, the friends of my Papan. Of course, they had a cat that aroused the surest of curiosities like my own. Needless to say, in a brief moment of time after pulling the cat's tail--just in that very moment did we agree that he would spare but for one scar, a light, invisible "C" on my cheek. Only I knew and those I showed this light, yet lasting scar. The cat showed mercy to me in that moment and thus--in the briefest of milliseconds of time I agreed to act as Protector of all cats among all kingdoms and across the Species. The years passed until the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, Two-Thousand sixteen. At the stroke of midnight, my scar disappeared from sight as clearly as the sun separates from the sky on the moonless, eclipsed night. That night I knew my calling was sent and so I made the appropriate arrangements to attend the conference, in the role and limited capacities as a UN-protected general bystander, apprentice-journalist, and part-time historiographer. My knowledge of four languages proved vital for my attendance. I know two dialects of SCS (Southern Cat Syndicate), which is enough for other translators to fill in the gaps into other dialects. I also know human javaScript, R, and XML. These shall serve the cats for the exponential growth of Cat scratchlets, and any collar-maget reading and communication devices. Household Cat-scratchlet usage entirely bypassed the traditional personal cat padlet, with the Yarn-ball and Yarn-pad and immediately picked up with the Walkie-Talkies and Collar-phones. 
It is for these reasons, I surmise, that a new Cold War in Cat 
Fashion
may be near to erupt. According to reports, one semi-truck was
smuggled with Fancy-Feast Cans, and some say a small drone was operated. Therefore, the demand for more Human-Computer languages, cultures, and most of all fashionable accessories. <br />
According to most accounts, I collected through interviews, the
human-computer-technology swaps from underground manufacturing firms in the north are replete with the finest and most expensive Cat products and even palatial homes--vacant of human owners, except on paper. I found there are underground knitting and yarn cooperatives that span miles in all directions--at the depth of at times 1,500 feet. Two Cat-Friendly sky-scrapers were recently purchased by anonymous donors, under obvious pseudonyms as "Mr Smith the Brother of Miss Jen's sister's half-nephew-in-law"--clearly the syntax of Cats! It was clearly a curiosity of wealth for the cats and I was very happy for these friendly, rambunctious animals of the Highest Order. And so this recent curiosity placed the the truth in my possession, and so with respect for all Human Friends of Cats across the species, these details have not been spared. And yet, I must confess my account of this narrative in English is due in fact that my business partner and Co-Proprietor of TMSquare.net, Mr. Winslow from Chicago, only reads English. Be it known that our agreement of my 50.9% and Winslow's 49.1% means two different percentages. Although in truth Human math rounds up by the decimal point to my 51% ownership, the mathemecat axia define that in binary situations, i.e. logistic regressions, such as the TCat-Winslow divide, my 50.9% rounds down to 50% and thus in all cat kingdoms, Winslow is recognized as Fully One-Half Owner as clear as 50%/50%. I happen to know that mathematica only uses integers, but I certainly don't want to insult my business partner. After all, it seems to be Winslow that holds all the cards each time I read the news. For Cat Eyes Only. log-journal 20-02-16- Blog on the Greater Cat Kingdoms Papparrazi-shots devalue with the dissemination of selfies thus making the the private life easy, and therefore a photo on the Night in Toronto calling rumours over a recent Cat-Human Tri-Partite Continental Conference. Most obviously, for the exchange of cat freedoms, protections, and more public cat funding for peace, and also Feline technology-sharing agreements. <br /><br />These rumours are most assuredly true. The parties involved included the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate--which introduces the second economy (80% of underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and BC) currently under the direction of the crime boss "Don Leonzo" (grey Tabby, 8 years)--with the Middle-Region Canadian Cats (MRCC), and by conference call, NACK (Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom--a kingdom holding more underground wealth in little Halifax, Canada than Los Angeles and Chicago combined). I acted as Cat-Human translator under the contractual agreement with the MRCC, NACK, and the SCS. All parties agreed on the CN Tower, 10:30 p.m., Table A1, in Toronto as the most neutral location. No jumping out of the agreement at the last minute--even for the bravest of cats. The unnamed Human Lobbyists and Representatives from various nations, though mostly francophone nations, France, Canada, Quebec, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Israel, among other nations. One representative from Kellog (only private Lobbyist). I come before you in full disclosure and with open agreements of both the humans and cats, that in exchange for my translating services, I accept, as co-proprietor and representative of TMM (pronounced TMSquare), the unanimous nomination and sponsorship by the Certification and Knighting as Official Member of the Distinguished KCBB club. (Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling club--one of only eight other living humans.) Therefore, I assure you, fellow stock-holders that the future of TMSquare is bright. The second pronouncement is that the secret TMM co-proprietor's identity is none other than Winslow, the brother of Cyrus, now living in Seattle, Washington. Thomas Milton owns 50.9% and Winslow 49.1%. I ensure the Board that Cat-Human company ownship is now recognized by 38 mostly first-world countries.<br /></p><br />-20-02-16-<br /><strong>Blog on
