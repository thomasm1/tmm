<br /><br />
How does one measure a Cat's inspiration to go outside and excercise?
And, how does one evaluate the big-boned Tigers and Lions' depth or
fragility of modeling effort? Here at TMSquare Cat Fashion and
Technology Evaluators, our professional research efforts center on the
methodology of Cat-Human Metrics and Sharing of Technology toward the
Greater Cat-Cause: As always, the Halifax SPCA shall co-facilitate the
10% Pre- or Post-Tax Automatic Donation to Continental SPCAs and 
Cat-Parks (Including Sphere-Racing and Tower-Climbing-Races
for which 2014 marked the first race up the Dubai Towers, whose entire
height served 9 cat racers, outfitted with velco-claws and the ten-lane
Wall-Strip).  We at TMM also recognize there are no places of work or
business, except in certain regions, and so each of our franchised
locations cater to culturally-competent cat needs, likes, and most of all, delicacies of the wider Cat Kingdoms that are demanded of our services.
Each day we aim to prove TMM's eternal passion for serving the Cats and Cat-Households in the
vastness of the NorthWestern Continent. </p>

Re: Re: Re: Re:Lost data & Wrongful arrest of Winslow at Pike Place Fish Market Smuggling-Bust
<br />They say the algorithm serves for the rocket-head, and the data provide the rocket fuel. Therefore, my valued cat investors, whiskered friends, and feline colleagues that have gathered here tonight: I tell you this evening that no worthwhile failed attempts should be without the same grande spectactale as the successful liftoffs -- thus we can look with equanimity whether our rocket fuel is spilled in a static explosion of might and awe for the wider feline world to behold, even atop the launchpad. Or, and more preferably as intended--along a burning trail that traces to the skies above!  <br />
The facts are that some data were "spilled" over the weekend, and indeed the fireball was bright. Furthermore, the facts of Winslow's arrest, stolen scratchlet and stolen data reveal a different set of facts according to my view.  We should wait and rejoice for the billowing and blackening smoke, and the flames as they yet smolder even through this night.  In the name of progress we took our risk and in the name of progress we take our reward! <br />
I can assure you that Winslow's arrest, bond-hearing, and upcoming litigation will by no paw interfere with the next set of benchmarks, at least technically related. This W and I can guarantee.  In fact, as fortune and W's mystical foresight would have it, the competition, the market-regulators, they have in their possession a red-herring:  W's lost scratchlet carried the algorithms, as they were coded and pawed, and as they were  11-11-15--these were the algs used in conjunction with the data involved with the recent calamity.  They reflect lost progress from months earlier, relating to an unused--and easily discarded--branch of progress.  Since that time--and unrelated to any propriety tinged by the recent smoke--TMM took W's algs, then we created nine separate inter-dependent "t-solid rocket boosters" that provide new, dynamic data for  ninth of the energy-consuming(wasting), rocket-fuel data that is consumed upon the each ninth stage of "lift-off". Whether W's data and designs are implicated with the Pike Place Sting or not is simply a thing no cat or human will know, at least for now. The board does need to consider the upcoming dates of the MRCC's annual Dat-n-Cog &copy; Fashion Show, in which we cannot be found wanting. W will meet the one million euro bond well before this date. Nonetheless, the data spilt and the cat out of the bag, therefore, We, acting as governing board must act quickly--in spite of W's regretful absence--to vote for 100% Unveiling of the T-(9) Titanium, Turquoise, Cobalt and gold earring-bluetooth walkie-talkie--and we do have W's written assent and paw-print as I am now passing along. And so, I think there won't be any questions from media regarding W's current legal situation, or they'll be deflected given that my contact let me know he'll be free by the morning. However, questions will linger as to the reason for his whereabouts at Pike Place, and how arrested? I too, share your concern and yet technical plans must nonetheless go forward on the WM-Nine-SRB-Coordinator! <br />For Cat Eyes Only<br />

fIGHTS, FIGHTS, and more FIGHTS! It seems every single decision must be reconsidered, and nuanced, and then 
rejected all in a day's work with Winslow. Reading his msg this morning, wow: I haven't spoken to him in 5 months and not written with him in maybe
three days and in that span of time has transpired: a) New debates of the spelling of MeeooW Inc. or Meeoow Inc. because Winslow can't stand for his name to be lower case. He is incensed over the matter still. Winslow has no idea in the world how the English language works, but amazingly this cat has a way with irony and sarcasm and double entendres, so go figure.
More perplexing is Winslow's absolute disbelief in superstition--cats are by far the most superstitious civilization I have ever encountered. I'm no theologian, so I don't pry into these matters. Well, W's solution is to invert the name to "OoWMee", or back to "OwMe" or rather--"Owe-Me.net"? A bit scathing for a company name.  TMM has provisions for a three-month runway for turning profit, and we don't even have a name yet! <bt />By any other business plan, my situation would virtually prophecy failure. Yet, Winslow and I agree on a number of ideologies, and one big item is that we both reject bourgois business models that must immerse itself instantly into debt, first to early-investors, then banks, then promised riches to share-holders.<br /> We arrive there by inverting "stages", not the whole process, along the path toward maturity. Just like the sentence that is reversed, not by its structure but by the parts, the words. Hence, the structure achieves the same purpose, and yet the words are reversed, providing nuanced and better meaning. Thus mean-ing is ing-mean. "Preview" in the old sense is now "Viewpre" in the new meaning. Cat's are naturally ambi-directional, yet thankfully I read right to left thanks to Hebrew's direction.  MMMmhhhh. I still prefer a form of w Meow.net over Owme.net. <br />
Rather than being led by the cart of debt and promised profit, year after year, TMSquare grants us the freedom to put the cart after the cat, that we may forage forth along the path of what is good, what is beautiful, and what is useful (which by our non-bourgeois logic, translates into profit anyway). We never fear, but we do admire the cart of growing profit in our rear-view shoulder-holster mirrors, as somehow this enterprise gains momentum by the brawn of one cat and the logic of one man... so, again, Winslow, shall it be "Meow?" "Owme" (which still leaves Winslow uncapitalized, and worse yet is "Woem", which makes backward letters and cats are almost always very superstitious against this sort of reverse. Absolute taboo) or "meow" MeeoW, ..? Perhaps this may satisfy Winslow and his whimsical taste--a taste that may alter the digital-fashion lives of thousands of cats across the land.

 23-02-16- 
I at first turned down two initial offers to participate as a translator on account the commitment and the danger. Set in a cushy weekly piece that kept my free time at bay, I hardly had thoughts of flying to Toronto for 4 nights.
But my calling as a Citizen of the World called me North. Let us say
that I felt comopelled because I learned the many dialects of Feline
from an encounter in my youth. As a boy of perhaps a few years, our
family house-sat at the English neighbors, the friends of my Papan. Of course, they had a cat that aroused the surest of curiosities like my own. Needless to say, in a brief moment of time after pulling the cat's tail--just in that very moment did we agree that he would spare but for one scar, a light, invisible "C" on my cheek. Only I knew and those I showed this light, yet lasting scar. The cat showed mercy to me in that moment and thus--in the briefest of milliseconds of time I agreed to act as Protector of all cats among all kingdoms and across the Species. The years passed until the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, Two-Thousand sixteen. At the stroke of midnight, my scar disappeared from sight as clearly as the sun separates from the sky on the moonless, eclipsed night. That night I knew my calling was sent and so I made the appropriate arrangements to attend the conference, in the role and limited capacities as a UN-protected general bystander, apprentice-journalist, and part-time historiographer. My knowledge of four languages proved vital for my attendance. I know two dialects of SCS (Southern Cat Syndicate), which is enough for other translators to fill in the gaps into other dialects. I also know human javaScript, R, and XML. These shall serve the cats for the exponential growth of Cat scratchlets, and any collar-maget reading and communication devices. Household Cat-scratchlet usage entirely bypassed the traditional personal cat padlet, with the Yarn-ball and Yarn-pad and immediately picked up with the Walkie-Talkies and Collar-phones. 
It is for these reasons, I surmise, that a new Cold War in Cat 
Fashion
may be near to erupt. According to reports, one semi-truck was
smuggled with Fancy-Feast Cans, and some say a small drone was operated. Therefore, the demand for more Human-Computer languages, cultures, and most of all fashionable accessories. <br />
According to most accounts, I collected through interviews, the
human-computer-technology swaps from underground manufacturing firms in the north are replete with the finest and most expensive Cat products and even palatial homes--vacant of human owners, except on paper. I found there are underground knitting and yarn cooperatives that span miles in all directions--at the depth of at times 1,500 feet. Two Cat-Friendly sky-scrapers were recently purchased by anonymous donors, under obvious pseudonyms as "Mr Smith the Brother of Miss Jen's sister's half-nephew-in-law"--clearly the syntax of Cats! It was clearly a curiosity of wealth for the cats and I was very happy for these friendly, rambunctious animals of the Highest Order. And so this recent curiosity placed the the truth in my possession, and so with respect for all Human Friends of Cats across the species, these details have not been spared. And yet, I must confess my account of this narrative in English is due in fact that my business partner and Co-Proprietor of TMSquare.net, Mr. Winslow from Chicago, only reads English. Be it known that our agreement of my 50.9% and Winslow's 49.1% means two different percentages. Although in truth Human math rounds up by the decimal point to my 51% ownership, the mathemecat axia define that in binary situations, i.e. logistic regressions, such as the TCat-Winslow divide, my 50.9% rounds down to 50% and thus in all cat kingdoms, Winslow is recognized as Fully One-Half Owner as clear as 50%/50%. I happen to know that mathematica only uses integers, but I certainly don't want to insult my business partner. After all, it seems to be Winslow that holds all the cards each time I read the news. For Cat Eyes Only. log-journal 20-02-16- Blog on the Greater Cat Kingdoms Papparrazi-shots devalue with the dissemination of selfies thus making the the private life easy, and therefore a photo on the Night in Toronto calling rumours over a recent Cat-Human Tri-Partite Continental Conference. Most obviously, for the exchange of cat freedoms, protections, and more public cat funding for peace, and also Feline technology-sharing agreements. <br /><br />These rumours are most assuredly true. The parties involved included the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate--which introduces the second economy (80% of underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and BC) currently under the direction of the crime boss "Don Leonzo" (grey Tabby, 8 years)--with the Middle-Region Canadian Cats (MRCC), and by conference call, NACK (Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom--a kingdom holding more underground wealth in little Halifax, Canada than Los Angeles and Chicago combined). I acted as Cat-Human translator under the contractual agreement with the MRCC, NACK, and the SCS. All parties agreed on the CN Tower, 10:30 p.m., Table A1, in Toronto as the most neutral location. No jumping out of the agreement at the last minute--even for the bravest of cats. The unnamed Human Lobbyists and Representatives from various nations, though mostly francophone nations, France, Canada, Quebec, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Israel, among other nations. One representative from Kellog (only private Lobbyist). I come before you in full disclosure and with open agreements of both the humans and cats, that in exchange for my translating services, I accept, as co-proprietor and representative of TMM (pronounced TMSquare), the unanimous nomination and sponsorship by the Certification and Knighting as Official Member of the Distinguished KCBB club. (Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling club--one of only eight other living humans.) Therefore, I assure you, fellow stock-holders that the future of TMSquare is bright. The second pronouncement is that the secret TMM co-proprietor's identity is none other than Winslow, the brother of Cyrus, now living in Seattle, Washington. Thomas Milton owns 50.9% and Winslow 49.1%. I ensure the Board that Cat-Human company ownship is now recognized by 38 mostly first-world countries.<br /></p><br />-20-02-16-<br /><strong>Blog on
