        <p class="parag"> <strong>The Process of Statistical Consulting</strong></p><p> 

Better Statistical Consulting offers services that fall under two broad categories: assisting with research design and statistical considerations for your study, and performing the data analysis with the appropriate explanation of results. BSC quotes each service separately, so clients may choose to use one service or both, depending on the stage of their project. This allows clients to choose the level of assistance best suited to their project. </p><p class="parag">

The process of research design includes choosing an appropriate methodology, study design, sampling methods as applicable, and forming a data analysis plan. </p><p class="parag">

The process of statistical work includes executing the data analysis plan, interpreting results and writing up findings according to the medium of distribution (article, dissertation, etc.). </p><p class="parag">

BSC handles all of the work on clients’ projects directly. All communication will is directed between the owner, Ms. Pasko, and the client.

</p><p class="parag"><strong>

What happens when I contact BSC about my project?</strong>

<ul class="paraglist">

<li>The initial consultation is free of charge. The purpose of the initial consultation is for the consultant to gather some information about the clients’ study so that clients can be provided with a quote.

The best time to speak with a consultant is at the beginning of a project. Better Statistical Consulting offers unlimited email, phone and Skype support through the entirety of the client’s project, allowing for the strategic advantage of aligning research questions and study goals with the correct methodology and data plan. This approach will save the client time and money, and the work will be built upon a solid statistical foundation.</li>

<li>

Hiring a consultant to guide you through your methods section will ensure that the study design, measures (e.g. independent and dependent variables), research questions, hypotheses, data analysis plan and sample size justification all work together coherently. Clients receive unlimited telephone and email support in case you have any questions about the results.

</li>

<li>

It is crucial to have a consultant hired by the data analysis phase of your project. BSC performs all of the study-appropriate analyses using the latest versions of STATA and SPSS statistical computing software.  BSC delivers all of the results (e.g. tables and graphs) to you as Microsoft Word documents, along with a written narrative interpretation that demonstrates how to interpret and report the results. Also included is unlimited telephone, email, and Skype support to answer any questions that clients might have.</li>

<li>

You will receive continued telephone and email access to me all the way up until the day you graduate. If you or your committee members have any questions about the statistics, I will be prepared to help you answer them.</li>
