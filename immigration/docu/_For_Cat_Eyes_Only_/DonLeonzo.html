<br />On Young Cy<br />Contrary to most understanding, the Middle Region Canadian
Cats (MRCC) hail from their territorial provenances in the West.  <br />According to the revered
geographer and cultural mystic, i.e., Cyrus the brother of Winslow (brother by pedigree and caretakers, 
yet brothers hetero-litter--(As Winslow once coined it)--the same from brother Cyrus,
Alliegiance intrinsic to the praiseworthy Feline Species, as custom would have it, derives 
from  --1.(Very often at the address of the human caretakers), and of course, "CW", or as 
some refer of the Higher Power of all Cats, The "Collective Whim". <br />Cyrus, in the musings of his street 
days, first pawed the now fashionable custom of the cats: At the sight of food, look up and pay mind 
to Cat King, Cat Kin, and Cat Kind! Cyrus' other <i>cat fad</i> from many seasons ago, was his battle cry first learned upon
the near-capture by a traveling band of ill-minded motorized humans--with the shrill that shattered each 
tempered pane among the motorized caravan--Winslow shrieked, Give me my Whim or Give me my next life! What a sight
it was, I'm told. The ill-intentioning caravaners tried to capture Cyrus, Cy 
vanished before the last pain fell to the iced highway.  Yet Cy's greatest yet contribution was a careful outlining
of the MRCC and their regions.<br /> There are two reasons as outlined by the charter--first known as the 
<i>Continental Cat Understanding</i>, that along with what is now the Northern Alliance, 
they should to fight for better trade--whether for the livery trading of fish, 
new yarn, and other staples unavailable in the hinterland. 
These, according to Cy, separated from the Southern Cat Syndicate around the time when the 
notorious Don Leonzo was a mere yeungling kitten, yet oblivious to the massive fortuned 
empire amassed by the lineage of his mother care-taker, Leona. <br />
Very little is known of this rich lore. Leonzo, once grown to strong kitten, continued in the same vein of 
<i>territorializing</i>--as the cat's call it--over the course of eight seasons, through 
networks.<br />Troubling as it appeared, this began to irreversably sidetrack the peace of the cat trade--fancy
feast cans quintrupled in cost--forget the new yarn!! The street and domestic dealings of fish narrowed and great
apprehension grew in the land. This of course fractured much trade into the second cat economy,
leading to many misunderstandings. The Jaguars of the north became convinced of this solution--
what was then named the Coastal Underground Economy. Thus, the riches from the Halibut, 
as much as from the common yarnlet trickets, grew even more sparse. 
<i>Topsy-Turvy Inteet!!!</i> as Cy would love to meow. 
Hunger, as any cat would reason, devalues any economy. Thus, for a long period of seven times the four seasons,
there were so few affordable delicacies for those not willing to parlay.  Fancy Feast deprivation, from the cold, grey sky over the November beaches of the West to the parched, heated piercing sky over the jungles of the East.  One may say, they were dire days--or, so it is according to my source--for I, as human, can only repeat what is reported to me, which is my Oath of Herodotus, per my Historiographical Contract to recount the daily lives that most fashionably shapes cat lives across all kingdoms. <br /> For Cat Eyes Only <br />
