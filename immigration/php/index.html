      <h2 style="text-align:center;color:yellow;">“Treatise on the Roles and Examples of Social Capital as Protective Determinants of Healthy Aging: <br />How Our Social Networks Affect our Health, along with the Details” </h2>

      <br />

      <h4 style="float:right;color:yellow;padding-right:15px;">A short discussion from Thomas Maestas<h4><br />

      <br />

      

      <p>Social determinants play a role in shaping our lifestyle habits, and in turn our health. Social determinants, networked as they are by our myriad and various influences, create an excellent opportunity to apply social network analysis with specific determinants of great interest and consequence. Peer influence on drinking serves an old, yet vastly complex example. Health generally, and specifically healthy aging along the life course. Although our primary social networks begin with our life-partners and our families, there is significant, and highly variable, influence from outside our nuclear families. I speak on the social places of our work, the boards we serve on, our leisure activities, our places of worship, and so on. In other words, those that we trust in our lives and those that trust us, we share information at varying levels of confidence and exclusivity for its value. These criteria begin to define what it is we call our social networks. And so this excerice is the the beginning of thinking in terms of of networking, measured by social capital, as a resource and at times detrimental object of exchange. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>I. Social network behavior. Information we learn from others through interaction and mimicry-observation is exemplified by what we learn in close contact, learned techniques of any activity. These are what we can generally call peer influence. Recent literature and advances in social network analysis have closely specified models that measure symmetry, content, structure, and other features that are reducible to quantitatve measure and analysis. Social capital indicators from observations, experimental or not, provide the content of analysis when we study social exchanges between between individuals (also called nodes) within a network. These exchanges help determine the jobs we find and choose, the food and drinks that we taste and partake, yet they also help us perceive and define "good" nutrition and "moderation". On choices of health, our social lives, our trusted social networks inform us which doctors, which insurance plans, and which pharmaceuticals "work best". Our future outlook on life, and other indicators of good mental health are linked to our social networks, according to research [Lin, Social Networks and Social Capital]. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>II. What determines health? Why and where. We can tie in these social determinants to health outcomes that vary widely between states in America and between nations across the globe. Within first-world nations by GDP, there is surprising variability. So, why do some nations’ citizens live longer and healthier? Is it because of the fish in the water in Norway, where the average life-span is above 80 years? Fishing and nutrition are a constant, however, Norwegians are living 7% longer in 2014 than 1990. So, is it advances in pharmaceutical science--whether preventative or ameliorative. It could be the air, yet we would be remiss to not look at their habits of lifestyle. Walking habits and other daily affairs are altered by social dynamics. If a quarter of the office regularly takes breaks to stand, stretch or walk around the block or a flight of stairs, then chances are the habit will catch on like a but to those least immune, and more succeptible to long-wished-for healthy habits. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>III. Cultural diversity of social beliefs, norms, and behaviors: How can we qualitatively assess social networks and influencing dynamics that alter determination? What role do social networks and the dynamics of daily social lives look like? Could there be a difference in the manner that different nationalities and regions socialize and thus behave, especially as they age? We hear of vastly different social perspectives and practices around health between cultures, often easily categorized along Western versus Eastern cultures, and the valuing of individuality versus valuing of community. To this end, I cite vivid set of examples provided by Dr. Ziarat Hossein, of the University of New Mexico. His 2015 presentation, entitled “Changing Age Structure and Cultural Perspectives on Aging – Contexts of Family and Care” analyzes varing views, exemplified by elder nuclear family members living with younger generations, or nursing home or worse, homelesssness. The work speaks of the cultural diversity of social beliefs, norms, and behaviors around aging, and that these cultural beliefs have ramifications for later living arrangements, responsibilities, and so on. Even the status in occupatonal networka and practices of hierarchy, mobility, and shared skills and multi-level technical training begins to redefine the roles along age lines--this is an open question for new and never-identified cases of agism in the workforce--surely a subject for another day, a rainy day maybe. Some face the challenge, as Sociologist Amy Whitfield's work on the generational differences and conceptions between the digital-native millenials, generation X, the baby boomer generation. And so looking around, there are profound differences along demographic terms around the globe from which each nation shares a common denominator--we as a species are living longer and healthier with new abilities that can be erroneously overlooked. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>IV. Identifying social networks: Case in point, Ethnic Enclaves of community-minded networking and disproportionately healthy birthrates. Given our purposes in this essay to identify the social determinants that perpetuate healthy outcomes, and often outcomes widely varying between groups. Our job is to scientifically and empirically quantify the patterns of these social influences of healthy living. Maybe the most palpable example in recent literature like "Ethnic Enclaves of community-minded networking and disproportionately healthy birthrates", by Drs. Theresa Osypuk, Linda Bates, and Dolores Acevedo-Garcia. They authoritatively write on the birthweight paradox and other specifically identifiable health outcomes that defy usual predictive models regarding Latinos--unusually healthy outcomes even within low-income families in low-resource neighborhoods. As a matter of fact, they found that residential ethnic enclaves, Mexican and other, improve birth outcomes. Why? because social capial and social networks offer women institutional or financial support (Portes and Rumbaut, 2006) during pregnancy; Look at the social networks and &lt;i&gt;social control&lt;/i&gt; among family and community expectations in the enclave. They reinforce norms regarding healthy behaviors and practices and sanctioned unhealthy ones. Never forget our colorful cigarette boxes and salad menu laws between New York City and rural Alabama. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>V. Measuring this phenomenon using social network analysis: Don't worry, it's only a brief 101 on Social network behavior. How ever to measure social determinants, as they live in networks, on healthy living? Our social networks vary in strength, in distance, in symmetry (for example, when trust is not reciprocated). Some of our networks are bunched together, others broaden and partially overlap other of ou many network, some are exclusive and span long-distant resources, and so on. We know about active networking activities such as professional or academic networking to access resources, yet there is also a passive role of social networks--the machinations of which we are often partially aware--whether or not we find our selves as a bridge between two large networks, we fill a communication gap and our own value and decision-making power increases--this occurs outside our control--an example of exogenous network forces that constantly change structure and alter present and future outcomes--sometimes one network reaches another network and information comes to light to alter even the past--this is the nature of the exogenous dynamics of the social determinants within our lives. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>VI. Social networks better understood: Social Capital is an easy observation. In his influential book, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community (2000), Robert Putnam identified seven dimensions of social capital (political participation, civic participation, religious participation, workplace networks, informal networks, mutual trust, and altruism), and showed that there are two distinct, though not necessarily mutually exclusive, types of social capital: bridging social capital (inclusive, outward-looking social networks), and bonding social capital (exclusive, inward-looking social networks). In addition Putnam explored changes in social capital over the 20th century, demonstrating that social capital increased between 1900 and the 1960s, then decreased dramatically as a result of pressures of time and money, mobility and sprawl, television, and generational differences. No clearer examples could be made. </p>

      <p>VII. So, we have come to an exciting discussion and agreement on this ubiquitous, yet hard-to-define social determinant that is both an active tool for accessing health resources and it is also the unconscious element of our psychological make-up by which we learn, we mimic behavior and vice versa we unknowlingly teach through our actions. So, what does the social scientist do about this quandary of needing to quantify a "determinant" of this sort, which language can scarcely qualify. The very first critical step as a scientist is to not overstep the bounds of accepted philosophical tenets of the nature of humans as social beings. Harvard Sociologist Stanley Lieberson, in his 1991 Presidential Address, remarked that social science can capitalize on the power of probabilistic methods when speaking about social determinants--so, we say that certain social conditions of X, Y, and Z, like poverty, social service retrenchment, etc., as specified within our theoretical model, alter the likelihood of differing outcomes. However, theoretical explanations of causality, such as the true science of vaccine risks, that involve a set of sequences toward determining an outcome is not useful if the probabilitilies in the model don't add up to 1.0. You know, I can't have a 40% chance of correctly calling heads, at the same time as having a 90% chance of correctly calling tails. So, we need to be careful and modest in how we speak of social determinants. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>VIII. With this powerful tool at our disposal, and a profoundly complex understanding about networkin, how might we interpret the patterns of our social relations? In scientific terms we say that we make an empirical generalization into a theoretical model with which we deduce two or three hypotheses about an observed or experimental evidence. Evidence, whether supportive or negative evidence, is rare that we gain very reliable knowledge. The exception is through use of frequent, small observations that over time accumulate to practice-based, policy-ready social science. (This is a call for more social science funding from the National Institutes of Health.) Public health advocates and researchers, criminologists and educational theorists refer to social capital in common and shared terms as a symbolic measurement, has popularized the term for its intuitive metaphorical value. The downside is that the term has diffused into multiple meanings and multiple levels of analysis, so that apples are beginning to compare to yellows and so forth. Thankfully, social science has broken through past this impasse so that criminology, sociology and public health disciplines are converging back to the same page. That page is the methodological convergence onto contemporary social network analysis (SNA) theory. </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>IX. Rest assured that social scientists are beleagured in their efforts to capture the evidence of highly variant phenomena, not only identify and correctly rule out alternate explanations, yet understand a phenomenon well enough to predict social behavior--whether that be shopping trends, hospital-capacity forecasting down the continuum to the community and neighborhood needs. And in today's online and fast-paced world, we want more and more to model the future. What will demographics entail for 2017, 2020, or even 2050? We can thank the sociologists in the fields of observation and statistical institutes that open our eyes to our constantly evolving societies.</p><br />

        <h3>Research Statement</h3>

      </section>

      <p>My academic interests center on the methodology of education research in K-12 and higher education. Specifically, I research post-secondary education's potential in creating life opportunities, or in some cases potential pitfalls. For example, data on college graduation rates (sourced from the National Center for Education Statistics’ datasets on public, two-year community colleges) indicate an 81% 2-year-to-4-year transfer aspiration level among during students' first year. Yet, only 21% transfer within six years; this latter figure continues to decline, especially among low-income and first-generation college students. <br />
	  In this age, many of the education problems cannot be solved without referring to historical precedent for guidance. For example, compare the social-cultural conditions of three case studies on national education reform--that is, 1807-1830's Prussian reforms on free public primary education, and the 1870-1880's French Jules Ferry reforms that inspired free secondary schooling. The third historical period--surrounding the U.S. Higher Education Act and Congressional Reauthorizations between 1964 and 1972--aims to understand a similar nationalized route toward affordable public education access, i.e., post-secondary schooling--a college education that is apt for a globally competitive, and diversified, labor market in last century's information-based Third Industrial Revolution. </p>

	  <p style="color:blue;">My social-historical ethos, theoretically informed by Pierre Bourdieu's commitment to qualitative and quantitative research methods; further, social science must adhere to the tenets of reproducibility, metric validity, and actionable, scientific resolution. I use R Code and Stata programming to advance the precision and exponential power of statistical analysis, without ignoring the human-element through qualitative case-study research. Lastly, a little about myself: My family and nearly all of my descendants are from central and northern New Mexico. I was born in Idaho, spent my early childhood in Paris, France, and enjoyed residence in Buffalo, NY, Amarillo, TX and Albuquerque, NM. </p>
