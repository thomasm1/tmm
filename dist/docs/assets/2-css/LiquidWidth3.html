Scientific knowledge is born in the isolation of sterilized laboratories, among mathematical formula, and between binary digits of algorithmic computation. Behind this veil of isolation, scientific knowledge has the power to overturn impregnable tenets of scientific certainty by virtue of an enlightened paradigm, yet serves little utility until it is translated into representational form for the interpretation of its implications and credibility.  Gieryn’s map-making outlines the “downstream” factors that account for variable interpretations of scientific knowledge, especially during periods that governmental policies or economic interests are at stake.  The credibility of ‘valid’ scientific knowledge undergoes transformations during these periods because the representations of science are inevitably the product of ulterior motives. Despite examples of chicanery like anti-global-warming climatology or controversial tobacco toxicity studies, the episodes importantly manifest the social contingencies that influence scientific research by dragging its implications into ‘cultural spaces’ of debate. These debates then force the epistemic authorities of the ‘scientific community’ to legitimate certain scientific claims and sources while simultaneously discrediting others. This process is essential to the ‘translation’ of obscure science into widely accepted knowledge—except in the cases that expose disagreements between experts.

Therefore, even during periods of Kuhnian “normal science” in which the scientific methods, scientists and institutions do not change, the representations themselves undergo significant transformations.  Gieryn labels these contested representations as “boundary-work” by which mainstream attributions of scientific credibility are bestowed on certain methods and institutions in equal measure to the subtraction of credibility from others. Further, there is a need for boundaries to highlight invalid science in order to heighten the perceived power of authority and the credible knowledge of dominant institutions. Similar to Pasteur's effort to bring his lab results to the farm fields, science must be successfully represented in order to be believed. Once believed, science can then acquire financial and political resources by which it takes on cultural and epistemological value.  These cultural dynamics of representation are not included in Kuhn’s Structures of Scientific Revolutions, which would have shed light on the actual mechanisms of how revolutions move beyond scientific-journal debates toward actual resource acquisition.
 This process of converting natural science into cultural acceptance and application provides one argument for its kinship with the social sciences; in reverse manner, culturally accepted social policies are subjected to the scientific method in order to evaluate outcomes through probabilistic models. This blurring of the boundaries between the natural and the social sciences is complicated by the predictability of the scientific object of study, the limitations of experimental isolation and the job of creating falsifiable assertions beyond merely counterfactual approximations.  Further, the question about the unity of scientific knowledge borders on philosophy. Yet, the period of debate over including social science under the institutional sponsorship of the National Science Foundation exemplifies this transformation of arcane science into actual knowledge.

	The narrowly positivist representation of social science astounded me. The appeals for NSF inclusion only emphasized the quantitative aspects of economics, sociology and psychology as representative of social science validity. It was not until the assertions to place social science separately into the Foundation for the Social Sciences did the complex nature of the human as subject matter expose the need to supersede merely quantitative work with interpretive, qualitative work. On the other side of the coin, the hard sciences themselves were dragged toward human contingency on account of the final reckoning of all scientific discoveries: Only in their implications for human experience does a discovery take on meaning.
