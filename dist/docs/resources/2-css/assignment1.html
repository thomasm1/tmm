<h1>Stromberg Jazz Guitars</h1>

<p style="font-size:small;">
Stromberg's top models, with their colossal, nineteen-inch-wide bodies, provided the tremendous volume and projection needed for a rhythm guitarist to be heard in the large jazz orchestras of the 1940s. Charles and Elmer, father and son, worked together in Boston, beginning in the early 1930s. Though they competed for business with John D'Angelico in New York, their total output was only 636 instruments, a little more than half the number made by D'Angelico.

NMM 10863 reflects Stromberg's post-1940 style, with a single diagonal top brace and carved, rather than pressed, arching. The Master 400 was their top grade instrument, with a decoratively engraved and painted headstock veneer and maximum body size. Both Charles and Elmer died in 1955, as musical tastes were changing; rock and roll and country had begun to overshadow big band jazz as America's most popular musical styles.
