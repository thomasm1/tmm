They say that if the algorithm serves for the head of the rocket, it is the data length depth and height serves for rocket fuel. I can assure the board that Winslow's arrest and litigation is in no wise connected anything technically related. Winslow's algorithms, as they were coded and pawed, are as they were since 11-11-15. TMM took W's alg's, then we created five separate inter-dependent "t-solid rocket boosters" that provide new, dynamic data for every 1/5 of the real, rocket-fuel that is consumed upon initial ninths' stages of lift-off. Whether W is implicated with the Pike Place Sting is not a thing I could know even after the two days of transport. The board does need to consider the upcoming dates of the MRCK's annual Cat-D-DaG Show, in which we cannot be found wanting. W will not meet one billion euro by this date. Therefore, we, as a board must act quickly to vote for 100% Unveiling of the T-(9) Titanium, Turquoise, Cobalt and

My contact let me know he'll be free by the morning. However, questions will linger as to his whereabouts at Pike Place, and arrested? I too, share your concern and plans go forward on the On Time Five SRB-Coordinator.
