         <p>&ldquo;I think it is great how you are providing an opportunity  for people to recycle what they no longer wish to keep and give it to a good  cause.  Plus, I love knowing that someone  will have the delight of opening a surprise gift for the holidays that he/she  otherwise would not have.  Your project  makes me feel a part of something bigger than me, which is very  gratifying&rdquo;  <br />

         <p>&nbsp;I helped distribute unsolicited gifts to random people with Kalei  in December of 2012. It was a memorable experience. The others had wrapped and  bagged gifts and filled stockings for several days. They had designated some as  best for kids, men or women so we tried to select an appropriate gift for  whomever we stopped. People were so surprised to have something offered to  them. I think some people may have thought we were strange but then amazed when  they realized that this was a random act of kindness/generosity and that all we  wanted was for them to pass it on as possible. <br />

         <p>&ldquo;It is so much fun to watch  the ripple effect of this and to see total strangers tear up with joy from  receiving a gift from a stranger who wants nothing from them but who simply  wants to spread some positive energy in the community&rdquo;</p>

         <p>&quot;Up until recently,  Random Acts of Kindness were something I only appreciated on bumper stickers.  When Kalei approached me to participate in her gift givers project last winter,  I jumped on the occasion. Initially many people were cautious when we approached  them as total strangers, only to light up like Christmas trees when they  realized we were gifting them. A few months later I was in a retail store when  a total stranger approached me and several others with store-wide savings  coupons. She informed me she always prints extra coupons when she shops and  hands them out. Both of these experiences lifted my spirit and give me hope  that a brighter future lies ahead and begins with each and every one of  us.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

         <p>I cannot express to you the  joy that being a part of this brings. From the collecting, bagging, to giving  the joy within you builds. When you see a stranger&rsquo;s face go from confusion,  then slowly to understanding. That's when their smile appears,changing  everything. At that moment pure joy has taken over. It is amazing! In a world  that teaches us it's all about self. It is a blessing for my girls to be  involved with the sole purpose of others. Here is the best part. It doesn't  matter what your skin is, what your job or income is, or how different your  life's might be. This is a heart thing. Hearts working side by side….Why? Here  is the kicker. <em>Just because</em>. Giving  what every one of us desires. Simple kindness, love and joy. There is nothing  like it! __JENNA </p>

       <div id="apfour">&quot;When I first  joined Gift Givers Anonymous and helped distribute gifts to unsuspecting  receivers I was a bit apprehensive about approaching strangers.  I thought, &ldquo;If anyone approached me in such a  way, I would probably take a step back or keep walking.&rdquo;  After watching Kalei approach people with a  big smile, kind and comforting words, I thought, &ldquo;I can do this.&rdquo;  So I did.   The more I handed gifts the more comfortable I became.  The more comfortable I became the more I  watched the people I approached relax. <br />
         Watching people&rsquo;s reactions when we handed  them a gift for no reason, other than to spread some gifts of Kindness was pure  JOY!  The excitement on the people&rsquo;s  faces ... <a href="maryjoDiv.html" title="maryjo" target="_self">[click to read more about Mary Jo's experience]</a></div>
       <div class="test" id="apeight">
         <p> I was fascinated with the project when you  first told me about it. I think it is awesome to see people give to those in  need without expecting anything in return.  <br />
           It is great to see how just a little gift and  thought can really make someone else&rsquo;s day and make their face glow! It has  been a good experience to get my other friends involved in as well. <br />
           Giving from the heart is the most rewarding  feeling. We are all so blessed and it is great to have an opportunity to share  that blessing with others as well.  <br />
           (This  project) has grown like  an epidemic and epidemic of giving!!  <br />

    <p>Kalei, <br />
      I was overjoyed to receive gifts to help our women with breast  cancer!! I felt like an angel had come out of nowhere to help our struggling  women and their children. I was so happy to be able to deliver these gifts to  the families with our partnering organizations. You should have seen the faces  of the families as they received gifts just because….just because they are  special, just because they are going through a hard time, just because someone  out there was thinking of them and wanted to pay it forward!!! The spirit of  giving and healing go together. As I received, I gave. And as the women and  children received they will pass it on. It changes hearts and lives and I am so  honored to be part of it!!! <br />

  <p>Since our estate sale company has been using Gift Givers  Anonymous at the end of our sales, it has not only simplified our function both  for us and for our clients, but it has also enriched our lives so much knowing that  the things we didn&rsquo;t sell will be used to do good in the community.  Gift Givers Anonymous is an incredibly  amazing organization, and we enjoy and appreciate Kalei and Theresa and their  volunteers so much.</p>

  <p>I would like to Thank You for your donation to our  community. &nbsp;I have worked with many organizations that have offered  services but never seem to be reliable. &nbsp;<br />
    I have referred your organization to many other donors  because you schedule your pickups, arrive in a timely manner, bring sufficient  help and are very professional.<br />
    I understand the items donated are given to people getting a  new start in life or sometimes people that just need a Boost. &nbsp;<br />
    Again, thank you for your Community service.</p>

    We  have had the distinct pleasure of working closely with Gift Givers and, can say  with out question that they provide an essential service to both client and,  community combined. Their dedication and, hard work is beyond measure. No job  is too big and, no need goes unfurnished. They are a blessing to our city and,  a definite joy to work with.<br />

MCH  Family Outreach (family) case managers have been partnering with Gift Givers  Anonymous since before they had their current storage space.&nbsp; GGA has  filled a huge gap in the giving community – prior to GGA, there were almost no  resources for furniture and household items our families desperately need when  they are trying to recover from disastrous life events.&nbsp; Thank you GGA for  your cheerful generosity!&nbsp; You guys are a joy to work with and you make  our families&rsquo; and our lives much easier!<br />

    <strong><em><u>St. Martin&rsquo;s </u></em></strong></p>
  <p>Gift Givers Anonymous makes a huge impact in the lives of  the clients of St. Martin&rsquo;s Hospitality Center. Since August 2013, over 4,000  unique individuals have passed through our doors. These clients enter the  shelter in desperate need of everything: shoes, clothing, undergarments, food,  and hygiene products. The generosity of Gift Givers Anonymous allows us to fill  these most basic needs, especially since GGA donates throughout the year and  not just during the holiday season. GGA is also extremely important to clients  moving into new housing, as they provide furniture, kitchenware, and linens for  our clients. St. Martin&rsquo;s has many programs but only with the help of sister  programs, like Gift Givers Anonymous, could we fully support our clients at  each stage of their journeys. <br />

    First  of all I would like to say Gift Givers Anonymous has been a BLESSING to my  Ladies and Families in the Bridges Housing Program.  The furniture and other household items that  you all have donated have help out so many of my clients.  <strong><u> </u></strong><br />
    From the ladies and children in the Bridges Housing Program  and myself, we want to thank Gift Givers Anonymous for all of their Generosity  in giving and helping people in need.   Thanks again.</p>
