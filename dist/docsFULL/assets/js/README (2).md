This tutorial series for [AccioCode](https://www.youtube.com/user/CDPAdvertising "Accio Code on YouTube") is about all things Gulp. Similar to Grunt, Gulp has become increasingly popular for doing the same tasks that Grunt does, but in a more JavaScript friendly way.

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com "Gulp Website") will help you automate and enhance your workflow with easy to write tasks.

Using the power of node streams, gulp gives you fast builds that don't write intermediary files to disk.

##High Quality##

By enforcing strict plugin guidelines, we ensure that plugins stay simple and work as expected.
