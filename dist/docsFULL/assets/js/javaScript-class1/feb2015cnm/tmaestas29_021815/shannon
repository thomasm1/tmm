Hi Shannon, 
I've had a chance to look over the material (at least the printed material so far) and I understand fairly well where everyone is right now. It would be interesting to see if we're able to hear about the data sharing agreement with NCCD.  I did identify out of the Bern. Co Work Plan the Objective 1-1 and 1-3 as the most pertinent to our contribution in the whole affair, which is the integral piece. Well, I've written up a number of questions that are organized around the theme related to "identifying priority research questions for database analyses" and also "identifying potential data elements that could be red flag variables". Finally, the task of working with Jeremy Howard of CYFD to identify variables to add to datasets" will be the most constructive. This, and the related task of merging available datasets are only limited by our own creativity and imagination (not to be boasted to client!). In any case, I'm merely brainstorming and creating hypotheticals but I believe it's fairly constructive in, as it is said, applying our Mental Model of thinking about the Deep End data collection and analysis. Well, it will be good to meet at your convenience. By the way, are you in on Friday morning up to 11:30? Or next week also works as I'm mostly attuned to your preferred pace with matters. 
Also, I did visit the site on the propensity scoring and both the value of contrasting from traditional regressions is practically as important as the methods of it. Ironically, I du

Thanks so much!  So excited to have you on this project :)  Below is the link to the workshop for the propensity scoring.  I sent them a message asking about the possibility of both of us attend on-line at the $149 rate!  We'll see what they say.

Hi Shannon,
Thank you for the meeting and the opportunity to work with you on this exciting project.  I did check and do have access to the files in Box, so I'm good to go.  And, in cordial reciprocity, here are those two articles I mentioned in case you're interested in some Sunday afternoon leisure reading!  Sure enough, they were from the "John Roberts Collection".  Have a great week!
