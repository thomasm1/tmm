 Cy's greatest yet contribution was a careful outlining
of the MRCC and their regions.<br /> There are two reasons as outlined by the charter--first known as the 
<i>Continental Cat Understanding</i>, that along with what is now the Northern Alliance, 
they should to fight for better trade--whether for the livery trading of fish, 
new yarn, and other staples unavailable in the hinterland. 
These, according to Cy, separated from the Southern Cat Syndicate around the time when the 
notorious Don Leonzo was a mere yeungling kitten, yet oblivious to the massive fortuned 
empire amassed by the lineage of his mother care-taker, Leona. <br />
Very little is known of this rich lore. Leonzo, once grown to strong kitten, continued in the same vein of 
<i>territorializing</i>--as the cat's call it--over the course of eight seasons, through 
networks.<br />Troubling as it appeared, this began to irreversably sidetrack the peace of the cat trade--fancy
feast cans quintrupled in cost--forget the new yarn!! The street and domestic dealings of fish narrowed and great
apprehension grew in the land. This of course fractured much trade into the second cat economy,
leading to many misunderstandings. The Jaguars of the north became convinced of this solution--
what was then named the Coastal Underground Economy. Thus, the riches from the Halibut, 
as much as from the common yarnlet trickets, grew even more sparse. 
<i>Topsy-Turvy Inteet!!!</i> as Cy would love to meow. 
Hunger, as any cat would reason, devalues any economy. Thus, for a long period of seven times the four seasons,
there were so few affordable delicacies for those not willing to parlay.  Fancy Feast deprivation, from the cold, grey sky over the November beaches of the West to the parched, heated piercing sky over the jungles of the East.  One may say, they were dire days--or, so it is according to my source--for I, as human, can only repeat what is reported to me, which is my Oath of Herodotus, per my Historiographical Contract to recount the daily lives that most fashionably shapes cat lives across all kingdoms. <br /> For Cat Eyes Only <br />
	Federal enforcement against those who violate wildlife protection laws dates back to 1900, when Congress passed the Lacey Act.  In the face of illegal hunting, particularly illegal commercial hunting, many game species in the United States were threatened with extinction.  Although states had regulations designed to protect wildlife from overhunting, those laws could not contend with the interstate commerce in wildlife that drove the trade in illegal wildlife.  The Lacey Act and subsequent federal wildlife statutes addressed that problem.  In particular, the Lacey Act makes it a federal crime to break the wildlife laws of any state, tribe, or foreign country, and then move or trade the wildlife across U.S. borders.
	"In the years since passage of the Lacey Act, the nationâ€™s wildlife protection statutes have taken on additional force and have been used to curb international trafficking in endangered and threatened species including: black coral, tigers, ginseng, tortoises, striped bass, ..."
