Wanted Dead or Alive, considered armed with claws and dangerous.  This was the sign I happened on, and yet I thought to myself of Win's comment, "...and the Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom (NACK) had lost direction years ago when their supreme leader, Gateau the Bob Cat, was kidnapped and held at the Federal Prison for Criminal Cats, a.k.a. the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.  As the leader of the wealthy Halifax-based kingdom, Gateau's break was undoubtedly orchestrated via truckloads of Fancy Feast bribes.  As you recall, Gateau's wealth is bested only by the infamous Don Leonzo, crime boss of the Southwestern Cat Syndicate. According to Casper, whose eyewitness account I do trust, the federalis had planned a simultaneous raid aiming to catch Gateau ordering the interception of Fancy Feast can shipments, along with New-Yarn and Cat-Nip cross-country, inter-state shipments. All the evidence had systematically disappeared during the trial, leading to a hung jury. Notwithstanding, as Casper recounts, the judge ruled jure banco "rule of the [judge's] bench," and thus Gateau was sent to the Capitol Zoo under the pseudonym "Ollie" the Bobcat.
