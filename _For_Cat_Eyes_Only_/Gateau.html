Wanted Dead or Alive, considered armed with claws and dangerous.  This was the sign I happened on, and yet I thought to myself of Win's comment, "...and the Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom (NACK) had lost direction years ago when their supreme leader, Gateau the Bob Cat, was kidnapped and held at the Federal Prison for Criminal Cats, a.k.a. the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.  As the leader of the wealthy Halifax-based kingdom, Gateau's break was undoubtedly orchestrated via truckloads of Fancy Feast bribes.  As you recall, Gateau's wealth is bested only by the infamous Don Leonzo, crime boss of the Southwestern Cat Syndicate. According to Casper, whose eyewitness account I do trust, the federalis had planned a simultaneous raid aiming to catch Gateau ordering the interception of Fancy Feast can shipments, along with New-Yarn and Cat-Nip cross-country, inter-state shipments. All the evidence had systematically disappeared during the trial, leading to a hung jury. Notwithstanding, as Casper recounts, the judge ruled jure banco "rule of the [judge's] bench," and thus Gateau was sent to the Capitol Zoo under the pseudonym "Ollie" the Bobcat.


Ok, so everybody wants to know my whereabouts on this Night in Toronto due to rumours over a recent Cat-Human Tri-Partite Conference.  Most obviously cat freedoms, protections, and public cat funding in exchange for peace.  These rumours are most assuredly true.  The parties involved included the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate--which introduces the second economy (80% of underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and BC) currently under the direction of the crime boss "Don Leonzo" (grey Tabby, 8 years)--with the Middle-Region Canadian Cats (MRCC), and by conference call, NACK (Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom--a kingdom holding more underground wealth in little Halifax, Canada than Los Angeles and Chicago combined).  I acted as Cat-Human translator under the contractual agreement with the MRCC, NACK, and the SCS.  All parties agreed on the CN Tower, 10:30 p.m., Table A1, in Toronto as the most neutral location.  No jumping out of the agreement at the last minute--even for the bravest of cats.  The unnamed Human Lobbyists and Representatives from various nations, though mostly francophone nations, France, Canada, Quebec, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Israel, among other nations.  One representative from Kellog (only private Lobbyist).  I come before you in full disclosure and with open agreements of both the humans and cats, that in exchange for my translating services, I accept, as co-proprietor and representative of TMM (pronounced TMSquare), the unanimous nomination and sponsorship by the Certification and Knighting as Official Member of the Distinguished KCBB club. (Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling club--one of only eight other living humans.) Therefore, I assure you, fellow stock-holders that the future of TMSquare is bright. The second pronouncement is that the secret TMM co-proprietor's identity is none other than Winslow, the brother of Cyrus, now living in Seattle, Washington. Thomas Milton owns 50.9% and Winslow 49.1%. I ensure the Board that Cat-Human company ownship is now recognized by 38 mostly first-world countries.

 Using an Integrated Development Environment. There are many available. We will use IDLE or Spyder.
IDLE is installed when Python is installed. How to run IDLE is here:
