Kuhn’s Structure of Scientific Revolutions (SSR) presents a history of Western science punctuated by episodic shifts in factual interpretation and methodological premises, which are termed paradigms. Contrary to the hitherto scientific-historical conception of progress as coherent, linear and logically derived, paradigm analysis reveals that scientific progress also comprises an irrational, arbitrary human element.  This holds implications for the study of Knowledge because the origin and continuum of “infallible,” scientific-method endorsed models are held as foundational precepts of inductive theory. The upside is that the course of scientific advancement can be charted more accurately, and hence analyzed, according to these recurrent paradigm shifts. Details emerge about when and by whom advancements occur in addition to how human error or intransigence have impeded advancements.  Therefore the hard sciences, like the social sciences, are not immune from the element of groupthink, and the former can learn from the latter about error-prevention strategies like Abend’s seven nuances of theoretical models. 
SSR’s analysis of scientific progress begins with the paradigm that is essential to meaning-making, and it serves to orient research in terms of methodological rules and mapping toward clear objectives. Without a paradigm, scientific work is reduced to fact-gathering, Baconian observations of phenomena. By virtue of the paradigm, scientific knowledge increases the precision and scope of facts, the alignment of fact with nature, and the articulation of laws, constants and qualitative implications within the paradigmatic framework. The challenges, Kuhn outlines, are the determination of facts, matching fact with theory, and the articulation of theory. Analogous to puzzle-solving, these objectives are carried out only when the existence of a solution is expected and only by the methodological rules of the community. This is the rote, normal science that shields itself from anomalous, contradictory findings by problem avoidance or complex methodological adjustments.    
The central contribution of the book is the notion of revolutionary science by which innovative efforts to overcome crises of anomaly provoke novel articulations, rule-bending, and requestioning of a priori “textbook” fundamentals.  Because scientific progress is that which it does not see, the boon of a ‘crisis’ serves to periodically reorient scientific endeavor into new directions and self-definition. Akin to political revolutions wherein the old institutions are no longer adequate for contemporary polity, paradigmatic revolutions emancipate scientific thinking from antiquated assumption models, methods and terminology.  Kuhn argues for complete paradigm destruction because the retention of incompatible elements of older models inhibits the full development of burgeoning paradigms. For this reason, it is counterproductive of the scientific community to distort scientific history into a ‘continuous’ version for it only perpetuates the conception of a canonical edifice against which crises of anomaly should not provoke novel thinking.

In addition to ‘crises’ of anomaly, paradigm shifts also periodically arise due to new ‘relevant’ problems of an era or the advent of new technologies. Similar to Mannheimian knowledge that is relational and ineluctably tied to circumstances and social origins, Kuhnian knowledge (advancement) occupies proximal territory that is also dependent on the social circumstance of the researcher community.  What we know, what we want to know, and with what means we have to know all comprise the knower’s total ideology, which is part and parcel of membership in a scientific community. Therefore it is sometimes necessary to depart from the dominant scientific community in order to embrace a new ‘particular’ ideology of research.
