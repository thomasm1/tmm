                SPCAs and Cat-Parks (Including Sphere-Racing and Tower-Climbing-Races for which 2014 marked the first race up the Dubai Towers, whose entire height served 9 cat racers, outfitted with velco-claws and the ten-lane Wall-Strip). We at TMM
                also recognize there are no places of work or business, except in certain regions, and so each of our franchised locations cater to culturally-competent cat needs, likes, and most of all, delicacies of the wider Cat Kingdoms that are demanded
                of our services. Each day we aim to prove TMM's eternal passion for serving the Cats and Cat-Households in the vastness of the NorthWestern Continent. </p>

                 <p class = "p">
                 January 29   <br /><br/>Toronto, Ontario<br /> <br /> I at first turned down two initial offers to participate as a translator on account of the commitment and the danger. Set in a cushy weekly piece that kept my free time at bay, I hardly had thoughts of
                    flying to Toronto for 4 nights. But my calling as a Citizen of the World called me North. Let us say that I felt compelled because I learned the many dialects of Feline from an encounter in my youth. As a boy of perhaps a few years,
                    our Parisian family house-sat at the English neighbors, friends of Papan. Of course, they had a cat that aroused the surest of curiosities like my own. Needless to say, in a brief moment of time after pulling the cat's tail--just in
                    that very moment did we agree that he would spare but for one scar, a light, invisible "C" on my cheek. Only I knew and those I showed this light, yet lasting scar. The cat showed mercy to me in that moment and thus--in the briefest
                    of milliseconds of time I agreed to act as Protector of all cats among all kingdoms and across the Species. The years passed until the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, Two-Thousand sixteen. At the stroke of midnight, my scar disappeared
                    from sight as clearly as the sun separates from the sky on the moonless, eclipsed night. That night I knew my calling was sent and so I made the appropriate arrangements to attend the conference, in the role and limited capacities
                    as a UN-protected general bystander, apprentice-journalist, and part-time historiographer. My knowledge of four languages proved vital for my attendance. I know two dialects of SCS (Southern Cat Syndicate), which is enough for other
                    translators to fill in the gaps into other dialects. I also know human javaScript, R, and XML. These shall serve the cats for the exponential growth of Cat scratchlets, and any collar-maget reading and communication devices. Household
                    Cat-scratchlet usage entirely bypassed the traditional personal cat padlet, with the Yarn-ball and Yarn-pad and immediately picked up with the Walkie-Talkies and Collar-phones. It is for these reasons, I surmise, that a new Cold War
                    in Cat Fashion may be near to erupt. According to reports, one semi-truck was smuggled with Fancy-Feast Cans, and some say a small drone was operated. Therefore, the demand for more Human-Computer languages, cultures, and most of all
                    fashionable accessories. <br /><br /> According to most accounts, I collected through interviews, the human-computer-technology swaps from underground manufacturing firms in the north are replete with the finest and most expensive
                    Cat products and even palatial homes-- vacant of human owners, except on paper. I found there are underground knitting and yarn cooperatives that span miles in all directions--at the depth of at times 1,500 feet. Two Cat-Friendly sky-scrapers
                    were recently purchased by anonymous donors, under obvious pseudonyms as "Mr Smith the Brother of Miss Jen's sister's half-nephew-in-law"--clearly the syntax of Cats! It was clearly a curiosity of wealth for the cats and I was very
                    happy for these friendly, rambunctious animals of the Highest Order. And so this recent curiosity placed the the truth in my possession, and so with respect for all Human Friends of Cats across the species, these details have not been
                    spared. And yet, I must confess my account of this narrative in English is due in fact that my business partner and Co-Proprietor of TMSquare.net, Mr. Winslow from Chicago, only reads English. Be it known that our agreement of my 50.9%
                    and Winslow's 49.1% means two different percentages. Although in truth Human math rounds up by the decimal point to my 51% ownership, the mathemecat axia define that in binary situations, i.e. logistic regressions, such as the TCat-Winslow
                    divide, my 50.9% rounds down to 50% and thus in all cat kingdoms, Winslow is recognized as Fully One-Half Owner as clear as 50%/50%. I happen to know that mathematica only uses integers, but I certainly don't want to insult my business
                    partner. After all, it seems to be Winslow that holds all the cards each time I read the news. For Cat Eyes Only. log-journal- Blog on the Greater Cat Kingdoms Papparrazi-shots devalue with the dissemination of selfies thus making
                    the the private life easy, and therefore a photo on the Night in Toronto calling rumours over a recent Cat-Human Tri-Partite Continental Conference. Most obviously, for the exchange of cat freedoms, protections, and more public cat
                    funding for peace, and also Feline technology-sharing agreements. <br /><br />These rumours are most assuredly true. The parties involved included the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate--which introduces the second economy (80% of underground
                    cats and Alley-cats between LA and BC) currently under the direction of the crime boss "Don Leonzo" (grey Tabby, 8 years)--with the Middle-Region Canadian Cats (MRCC), and by conference call, NACK (Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom--a
                    kingdom holding more underground wealth in little Halifax, Canada than Los Angeles and Chicago combined). I acted as Cat-Human translator under the contractual agreement with the MRCC, NACK, and the SCS. All parties agreed on the CN
                    Tower, 10:30 p.m., Table A1, in Toronto as the most neutral location. No jumping out of the agreement at the last minute--even for the bravest of cats. The unnamed Human Lobbyists and Representatives from various nations, though mostly
                    francophone nations, France, Canada, Quebec, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Israel, among other nations. One representative from Kellog (only private Lobbyist). I come before you in full disclosure and with open agreements of both
                    the humans and cats, that in exchange for my translating services, I accept, as co-proprietor and representative of TMM (pronounced TMSquare), the unanimous nomination and sponsorship by the Certification and Knighting as Official
                    Member of the Distinguished KCBB club. (Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling club--one of only eight other living humans.) Therefore, I assure you, fellow stock-holders that the future of TMSquare is bright. The second pronouncement is that the
                    secret TMM co-proprietor's identity is none other than Winslow, the brother of Casper, now living in Seattle, Washington. Thomas Milton owns 50.9% and Winslow 49.1%. I ensure the Board that Cat-Human company ownship is now recognized

                    <p class="p"  >
                    <br />Contrary to most understanding, the Middle Region Canadian Cats (MRCC) hail from their territorial provenances in the West. <br />According to the revered geographer and cultural mystic, i.e., Casper the brother of Winslow (brother
                    by pedigree and caretakers, yet brothers hetero-litter--(As Winslow once coined it)--the same from brother Casper, Alliegiance intrinsic to the praiseworthy Feline Species, as custom would have it, derives from --1.(Very often at the
                    address of the human caretakers), and of course, "CW", or as some refer of the Higher Power of all Cats, The "Collective Whim". <br /><br />Casper, in the musings of his street days, first pawed the now fashionable custom of the cats:
                    At the sight of food, look up and pay mind to Cat King, Cat Kin, and Cat Kind! Casper's other <i>cat fad</i> from many seasons ago, was his battle cry first learned upon the near-capture by a traveling band of ill-minded motorized
                    humans--with the shrill that shattered each tempered pane among the motorized caravan--Winslow shrieked, Give me my Whim or Give me my next life! What a sight it was, I'm told. The ill-intentioning caravaners tried to capture Casper,
                    Cas vanished before the last pain fell to the iced highway. Cas' greatest yet contribution was a careful outlining of the MRCC and their regions.<br /><br /> There are two reasons as outlined by the charter--first known as the
                    <i>Continental Cat Understanding</i>, that along with what is now the Northern Alliance, they should to fight for better trade--whether for the livery trading of fish, new yarn, and other staples unavailable in the hinterland. <br
                    /><br /> These, according to Cas, separated from the Southern Cat Syndicate around the time when the notorious Don Leon was a mere yeungling kitten, yet oblivious to the massive fortuned empire amassed by the lineage of his mother
                    care-taker, Leona. <br /><br /> Very little is known of this rich lore. Leon, once grown to a strong stature, continued in the same vein of
                    <i>territorializing</i>--the silent cats's call--over the course of eight seasons, through networks of allies.<br /><br />Troubling as it appeared, this began to irreversably sidetrack the peace of the cat trade--fancy feast cans quintrupled
                    in cost--forget the new yarn!! The street and domestic dealings of fish narrowed and great apprehension grew in the land. This of course fractured much trade into the second cat economy, leading to many misunderstandings. The Jaguars
                    of the north became convinced of this solution-- what was then named the Coastal Underground Economy. Thus, the riches from the Halibut, as much as from the common yarnlet trickets, grew even more sparse.
                    <i>Topsy-Turvy Inteet!!!</i> as Cas would love to meow. Hunger, as any cat would reason, devalues any economy. Thus, for a long period of seven times the four seasons, there were so few affordable delicacies for those not willing to
                    parlay. Fancy Feast deprivation, from the cold, grey sky over the November beaches of the West to the parched, heated piercing sky over the jungles of the East. One may say, they were dire days--or, so it is according to my source--for
                    I, as human, can only repeat what is reported to me, which is my Oath of Herodotus, per my Historiographical Contract to recount the daily lives that most fashionably shapes cat lives across all kingdoms.<span class="excerpts">... more[1.1]</span>.<br />

                    discovery proceedings, W decided upon the north for direction. Since the age of the passage of the Lacey Act, the Western seas' wildlife protection statutes have only emboldened the international traffickers, while all cats have suffered
                    needlessly at the hands of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--the Death Star of the seas for what concerns all continental cats. Certain fish of the most peculiar and extraordinary of tastes--suddenly and de jure outlawed--spawned a new
                    black market entirely devoted to fish. Months passed, and a return to normalcy meant one thing only: The long, crushing suffering of Winslow's unwilling abstinence should come to an end. <br /><br />W's love affair with Yellowtail
                    amberjack Seriola lalandi would be restored. Tasty treats like these must never be heated above 1&deg; celsius (or in cat knowledge, 90 seconds out of ice--which is a rare fish whose purity of taste should trump play-time) Winslow
                    is a cat of extreme tastes, and each night he lit a candle for the separation--or at least, so I was told by W his self. The finest catch, so rare, so delicate, it was said that one tongue-lash, and any cat could be enamoured, so that
                    the expanse of the seas should be searched without avail for an equally sublime flavor. According to Winslow, all market machinations returned to normalcy--under the table--and yet, all in the shadows of the alley for certain fish.
                    This was so until the onset of "Operation Crush"--an effort led by, again, USFW drawing the ire of all Western cats, especially those most hurt by the operation. My concern is that no-one mentioned of any change or new action on fish
                    protectinos at the Tri-Partite Conference, involving cooperation of Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom, Middle-Region Canadian Cats, and the Southwestern Cat Syndicate. There are major problems that have my worst fears racing: If lawlessness
                    breaks out again between regions, the digital fashion trade, the electronics and technology sharing, legitimate trade--All at Risk! <br /><br />

                   <br /> Re: Re: Re: Re:Lost data &amp; Wrongful arrest of Winslow at Pike Place Fish Market Smuggling-Bust </p>
                   <p class="p">
                They say the algorithm serves for the rocket-head, and the data provide the rocket fuel. Therefore, my valued cat investors, whiskered friends, and feline colleagues that have gathered here tonight: I tell you this evening that no worthwhile failed attempts
                should be without the same grande spectactale as the successful liftoffs -- thus we can look with equanimity whether our rocket fuel is spilled in a static explosion of might and awe for the wider feline world to behold, even atop the
                launchpad. Or, and more preferably as intended--along a burning trail that traces to the skies above! <br /><br /> The facts are that some data were "spilled" over the weekend, and indeed the fireball was bright. Furthermore,
                the facts of Winslow's arrest, stolen scratchlet and stolen data reveal a different set of facts according to my view. We should wait and rejoice for the billowing and blackening smoke, and the flames as they yet smolder even through this
                night. In the name of progress we took our risk and in the name of progress we take our reward!<br /> <br /> I can assure you that Winslow's arrest, bond-hearing, and upcoming litigation will by no paw interfere with the next set of benchmarks,
                at least technically related. This W and I can guarantee. In fact, as fortune and W's mystical foresight would have it, the competition, the market-regulators, they have in their possession a red-herring: W's lost scratchlet carried the
                algorithms, as they were coded and pawed, and as they were 11-11-15--these were the algs used in conjunction with the data involved with the recent calamity. They reflect lost progress from months earlier, relating to an unused--and easily
                discarded--branch of progress. Since that time--and unrelated to any propriety tinged by the recent smoke--TMM took W's algs, then we created nine separate inter-dependent "t-solid rocket boosters" that provide new, dynamic data for everyninth
                of the energy-consuming(wasting), rocket-fuel data that is consumed upon the each ninth stage of "lift-off". <br /> <br />Whether W's data and designs are implicated with the Pike Place Sting or not is simply a thing no cat or human will know, at least
                for now. The board does need to consider the upcoming dates of the MRCC's annual Dat-n-Cog &copy; Fashion Show, in which we cannot be found wanting. W will meet the one million euro bond well before this date. Nonetheless, the data spilt
                and the cat out of the bag, therefore, We, acting as governing board must act quickly--in spite of W's regretful absence--to vote for 100% Unveiling of the T-(9) Titanium, Turquoise, Cobalt and gold earring-bluetooth walkie-talkie--and
                we do have W's written assent and paw-print as I am now passing along. And so, I think there won't be any questions from media regarding W's current legal situation, or they'll be deflected given that my contact let me know he'll be free
                by the morning. However, questions will linger as to the reason for his whereabouts at Pike Place, and how arrested? I too, share your concern and yet technical plans must nonetheless go forward on the WM-Nine-SRB-Coordinator! <br />

                    <br /> It makes now, let's see, seven months since we had last heard from engineering. The surprise did not disappoint anyone -- as it happens, the lofty idea of assigning five separate algorithms, with each of the five parts of the
                    data analysis, implies that each can also be equally distributed via the memory consumption. Both of the good news: Two thumbs up. So, what we do is to program five separate tasks for every large "dump" of unstructured public or non-public
                    data.
                    <br /><br /> Thus, for every four-processor pc out in the world: Taking the caspering cat to task, let's ask: Does it make more sense to assign four-hundred pounds to the one cat, and fifty pounds-each to the rest of the five standing
                    around? Or, does it better yet make more sense to specifically request that each of four, eight, or sixteen processors, that they distribute tasks likewise? If so, then: Off your seat, bat your paws, and     <span class="excerpts">... more[5.1]</span><br />

                    <p class="p">
                    <br />March 09<br /> 

                
                
                    <br /> <br /> fIGHTS, FIGHTS, and more FIGHTS! It seems every single decision must be reconsidered, and nuanced, and then rejected all in a day's work with Winslow. Reading his msg this morning, wow: I haven't spoken
                    to him in 5 months and not written with him in maybe three days and in that span of time has transpired: a) New debates of the spelling of MeeooW Inc. or Meeoow Inc. because Winslow can't stand for his name to be lower case. He is
                    incensed over the matter still. Winslow has no idea in the world how the English language works, but amazingly this cat has a way with irony and sarcasm and double entendres, so go figure. More perplexing is Winslow's absolute disbelief
                    in superstition--cats are by far the most superstitious civilization I have ever encountered. I'm not a theologian, so I don't pry into these matters. Well, W's solution is to invert the name to "OoWMee", or back to "OwMe" or rather--"Owe-Me.net"?
                    A bit scathing for a company name. TMM has graciously provisioned us for a three-month runway for turning profit, and we don't even have a name yet !<br /> <br />By any other business plan, my situation would virtually prophecy failure.
                    Yet, Winslow and I agree on a number of ideologies, and one big item is that we both reject bourgois business models that must immerse itself instantly into debt, first to early-investors, then banks, then promised riches to share-holders.<br
                    /><br /> We arrive there by inverting "stages", not the whole process, along the path toward maturity. Just like the sentence that is reversed, not by its structure but by the parts, the words. Hence, the structure achieves the same
                    purpose, and yet the words are reversed, providing nuanced and better meaning. Thus mean-ing is ing-mean. "Preview" in the old sense is now "Viewpre" in the new meaning. Cat's are naturally ambi-directional, yet thankfully I read right
                    to left thanks to Hebrew's direction. MMMmhhhh. I still prefer a form of w Meow.net over Owme.net. <br /><br /> Rather than being led by the cart of debt and promised profit, year after year, TMSquare grants us the freedom to put the
                    cart after the cat, that we may forage forth along the path of what is good, what is beautiful, and what is useful (which by our non-bourgeois logic, translates into profit anyway). We never fear, but we do admire the cart of growing
                    profit in our rear-view shoulder-holster mirrors, as somehow this enterprise gains momentum by the brawn of one cat and the logic of one man... so, again, Winslow, shall it be "Meow?" "Owme" (which still leaves Winslow uncapitalized,
                    and worse yet is "Woem", which makes backward letters and cats are almost always very superstitious against this sort of reverse. Absolute taboo) or "meow" MeeoW, ..? Perhaps this may satisfy Winslow and his whimsical taste--a taste
                    that may alter the digital-fashion lives of thousands of cats across the land. <span class="excerpts">more[6.1] ...</span>

        <h2>Gateau's Great Escape</h2> 
        <br /><p class="p"  >
            <br />
            september 6 <br />
            <br />
            Wanted Dead or Alive, considered armed with claws and dangerous.  This was the sign I happened on, and yet I thought to myself of Win's comment, "...and
             the Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom (NACK) had lost direction years ago when their supreme leader, Gateau the Bobcat, was kidnapped and held at the Federal Prison for Criminal Cats" ...,
              a.k.a. the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.  As the leader of the wealthy Halifax-based kingdom, Gateau's break was undoubtedly orchestrated via truckloads of Fancy Feast bribes.  
              The official storyline reads an elderly woman's Used Book Boutique, adjacent to the Western entrance of the Zoo, was used as a front for smuggling key players in the escape. Although the book-store front regularly featured 
              upwards of 8 to 10 cats in the windows and atop the books...but nobody would have guessed four-hundred cats passed through the front-door, spending a week in the window-sill, then into the tunnel system beneath, each dyad of cats forming teams, and teams incrementally populating key positions for the night of the second New Moon after Labor Day. 
              The National Zoo's underground Shale geology poses a dubious security risk into play on account of the crumbling nature of shale. 
            It's no wonder such an elaborate scheme would be funded by one of the world's richest cats. As you recall, Gateau's wealth is bested only by the infamous Don Leonzo, crime boss of the Southwestern Cat Syndicate. According to Casper, whose eyewitness account I do trust, the federalis had planned a simultaneous raid aiming to catch Gateau ordering the interception of Fancy Feast can shipments, along with New-Yarn and Cat-Nip cross-country, inter-state shipments. All the evidence had systematically disappeared during the trial, leading to a hung jury. Notwithstanding, as Casper recounts, the judge ruled jure banco "rule of the [judge's] bench," and thus Gateau was sent to the Capitol Zoo under the pseudonym "Ollie" the Bobcat.
            </p>[more 8.1]<p>
            <br />...<br />
            Not everyone knew the whereabouts of the next Cat-Human Tri-Partite Conference. Win, of course, would be going with his follow-up report dated from the Toronto Accords.
            These issues frame the basis of all cat freedoms, protections, and the ever-promised public cat funding in exchange for peace.  As expected, most of the the 38 participating nations ratified an agreement on tithes. 
            Other piece of order is the still lingering sanctions on the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate, i.e. the 2nd economy, catering to three quarters of the street-cat population, the 
            underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and British Columbia.  The primary economy driving the cat kingdoms originates from the Fort Knox of the north: Residing at 
            Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom. According to all accounts, The wealth in little Halifax, Canada is supposed to originate from a 17th century storied outpost, a French one, dealing in Fur Trapping--the most famous of which is the Waiting Whisky Trading Post.  As legend has it, the underground wealth stores were voraciously saved, and saved under paw and key: Beneath the sacred catacombs (Beyond which no humans would pass) were stored the riches. From generation to the next, each adding to the last. Under British occupation, it is said that history itself forgot her wealth--as nothing extant exists over that 130-period. Balance sheets reveal wealth transfer in one direction only--always a vacuum of disappearing sums, now revealed beneath the frozen tundra. 
            I can only surmise the French heritage protected the secrets. And, of course, Gateau takes the cake with such famous descendants. 
            Equally, just as these cats of the N.A.C.K. protected the regions by sustaining the very economy that feeds it! A marvel in the age of Big Credit &amp; Loans.                  
            <br />...<br />
            Following instructions from the the lead factory, purchased through Casper's contacts in Bellingham, Washington, work has begun on the cornerstone of the 3rd generation of cat-collars: 
        Using an Integrated Development Environment. There are many available. We will use IDLE or Spyder.
            IDLE is installed when Python is installed. How to run IDLE is here:
            http://www.annedawson.net/Python_Install_Run.htm
            Spyder is a more sophisticated IDE.

            For cat Eyes Only></For> 6. B And so how did I get entangled in this feline fiasco? Well, the larger the cat, the longer the tale to catch ... I had placed an ad in the local cat-news tribune for minor translating services, for 
            humans and also catering cats, for at least basic contracts for written works and to a lesser degree, oral translating meetings between two or more parties.  
            My knighting, nomination, and sponsorship by Certification as Official Member of the Distinguished KCBB club, Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling club sort of sealed the deal, sealed my fame, and ultimately my fortune--all depending on the 
            feuding outcomes of the power-hungry cat-kingdoms. For cat Eyes Only></For
