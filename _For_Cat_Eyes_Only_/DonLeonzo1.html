According to the revered geographer and cultural mystic, Cyrus the brother of Winslow (brother by pedigree and caretakers, yet brothers hetero-litter--(As Winslow once put it)--the same from 's brother Cyrus, Alliegiance intrinsic to the praiseworthy Feline Species as cliche would have it, derives from  Networked Will--(often identical to and mistaken for territory), Pedigreed Culture--(often identical to and mistaken for cohabitation with human caretakers, and of course, CW, or as some may regard as the Higher Power of all Cats, The Collective Whim. Winslow, in the rantings of his street days, first pawed the now fashionable custom of the cats, that is, to pour out the first three drops of pigeon blood to Cat King, Cat Kin, and Cat Kind! Winslow's other trendset from many seasons ago, was his battle cry upon near-capture by a traveling band of caravaned humans--with the shrill that shattered every tempered pane among the entire caravan--Winslow shrieked, Give me my Whim or Give me my next life! Those cursed caravaners intended with all their aim to achieve the latter, as Winslow vanished before the last shrapnel fell to soil.  Why the MRCC? Why regions? There are two reasons as outlined by the charter first known as the Continental Cats, that along with what is now the Northern Alliance, to fight for better trade--whether for the livery trading of fish, new yarn, and other staples unavailable in the hinterland.  These separated from the Southern Cat Syndicate at about the time when the notorious Don Leonzo was a mere yeungling kitten, yet oblivious to the massive fortuned empire amassed by his mother care-taker. Leona had assumed power over the course of eight seasons, through networks that irreversably sidetracked the cat trade, street and domestic dealings, and fractured most trade into the second cat economy--the Coastal Underground Economy. Thus, the riches from the Halibut, as much as from the common yarnlet trickets, that is the whole range of trading of goods became divided. This, as any cat would point out, irreversably devalued the first economy, and for a long period of seven times the four seasons, there were less affordable delicacies for those not willing to parlay.  Fancy Feast deprivation, from the cold, grey sky over the November beaches of Eureka, California to the parched, heated piercing sky over the deserts of Laredo, Texas.  One may say, they were dire days--or, so it is according to my source--for I, as human, can only repeat what is reported to me, which is my Oath of Herodotus, per my Historiographical Contract to recount the daily lives that most fashionably shapes cat lives across all kingdoms. <br /> For Cat Eyes Only <br />
