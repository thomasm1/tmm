/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

  <p>&ldquo;I think it is great how you are providing an opportunity  for people to recycle what they no longer wish to keep and give it to a good  cause.  Plus, I love knowing that someone  will have the delight of opening a surprise gift for the holidays that he/she  otherwise would not have.  Your project  makes me feel a part of something bigger than me, which is very  gratifying&rdquo;  <br />

  <p>&nbsp;I helped distribute unsolicited gifts to random people with Kalei  in December of 2012. It was a memorable experience. The others had wrapped and  bagged gifts and filled stockings for several days. They had designated some as  best for kids, men or women so we tried to select an appropriate gift for  whomever we stopped. People were so surprised to have something offered to  them. I think some people may have thought we were strange but then amazed when  they realized that this was a random act of kindness/generosity and that all we  wanted was for them to pass it on as possible. <br />

  <p>&ldquo;It is so much fun to watch  the ripple effect of this and to see total strangers tear up with joy from  receiving a gift from a stranger who wants nothing from them but who simply  wants to spread some positive energy in the community&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&quot;Up until recently,  Random Acts of Kindness were something I only appreciated on bumper stickers.  When Kalei approached me to participate in her gift givers project last winter,  I jumped on the occasion. Initially many people were cautious when we approached  them as total strangers, only to light up like Christmas trees when they  realized we were gifting them. A few months later I was in a retail store when  a total stranger approached me and several others with store-wide savings  coupons. She informed me she always prints extra coupons when she shops and  hands them out. Both of these experiences lifted my spirit and give me hope  that a brighter future lies ahead and begins with each and every one of  us.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>I cannot express to you the  joy that being a part of this brings. From the collecting, bagging, to giving  the joy within you builds. When you see a stranger&rsquo;s face go from confusion,  then slowly to understanding. That's when their smile appears,changing  everything. At that moment pure joy has taken over. It is amazing! In a world  that teaches us it's all about self. It is a blessing for my girls to be  involved with the sole purpose of others. Here is the best part. It doesn't  matter what your skin is, what your job or income is, or how different your  life's might be. This is a heart thing. Hearts working side by side….Why? Here  is the kicker. <em>Just because</em>. Giving  what every one of us desires. Simple kindness, love and joy. There is nothing  like it! __JENNA </p>
</div>
<div id="apDiv14">&quot;When I first  joined Gift Givers Anonymous and helped distribute gifts to unsuspecting  receivers I was a bit apprehensive about approaching strangers.  I thought, &ldquo;If anyone approached me in such a  way, I would probably take a step back or keep walking.&rdquo;  After watching Kalei approach people with a  big smile, kind and comforting words, I thought, &ldquo;I can do this.&rdquo;  So I did.   The more I handed gifts the more comfortable I became.  The more comfortable I became the more I  watched the people I approached relax. <br />
Watching people&rsquo;s reactions when we handed  them a gift for no reason, other than to spread some gifts of Kindness was pure  JOY!  The excitement on the people&rsquo;s  faces ... <a href="maryjoDiv.html" title="maryjo" target="_self">[click to read more about Mary Jo's experience]</a></div>
<div class="test" id="apDiv15">
  <p>    I was fascinated with the project when you  first told me about it. I think it is awesome to see people give to those in  need without expecting anything in return.  <br />
    It is great to see how just a little gift and  thought can really make someone else&rsquo;s day and make their face glow! It has  been a good experience to get my other friends involved in as well. <br />
    Giving from the heart is the most rewarding  feeling. We are all so blessed and it is great to have an opportunity to share  that blessing with others as well.  <br />
    (This  project) has grown like  an epidemic and epidemic of giving!!  <br />
