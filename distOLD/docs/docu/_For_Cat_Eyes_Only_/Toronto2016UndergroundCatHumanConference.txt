Ok, so everybody wants to know my whereabouts on this Night in Toronto due to rumours over a recent Cat-Human Tri-Partite Conference.  Most obviously cat freedoms, protections, and public cat funding in exchange for peace.  These rumours are most assuredly true.  The parties involved included the Southwestern Cat-Syndicate--which introduces the second economy (80% of underground cats and Alley-cats between LA and BC) currently under the direction of the crime boss "Don Leonzo" (grey Tabby, 8 years)--with the Middle-Region Canadian Cats (MRCC), and by conference call, NACK (Northern Alliance Cat Kingdom--a kingdom holding more underground wealth in little Halifax, Canada than Los Angeles and Chicago combined).  I acted as Cat-Human translator under the contractual agreement with the MRCC, NACK, and the SCS.  All parties agreed on the CN Tower, 10:30 p.m., Table A1, in Toronto as the most neutral location.  No jumping out of the agreement at the last minute--even for the bravest of cats.  The unnamed Human Lobbyists and Representatives from various nations, though mostly francophone nations, France, Canada, Quebec, Great Britain, Germany, Russia and Israel, among other nations.  One representative from Kellog (only private Lobbyist).  I come before you in full disclosure and with open agreements of both the humans and cats, that in exchange for my translating services, I accept, as co-proprietor and representative of TMM (pronounced TMSquare), the unanimous nomination and sponsorship by the Certification and Knighting as Official Member of the Distinguished KCBB club. (Kitten-Cat-Bling-Bling club--one of only eight other living humans.) Therefore, I assure you, fellow stock-holders that the future of TMSquare is bright. The second pronouncement is that the secret TMM co-proprietor's identity is none other than Winslow, the brother of Cyrus, now living in Seattle, Washington. Thomas Milton owns 50.9% and Winslow 49.1%. I ensure the Board that Cat-Human company ownship is now recognized by 38 mostly first-world countries.
